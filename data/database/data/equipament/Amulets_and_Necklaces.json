However, Amulet of Loss does not protect against experience and skill loss, which full blessings do. If you die in PVP with the Twist of Fate blessing and wearing an Amulet of Loss, you will only lose Twist of Fate.\nIt does not work on Red Skulled and Black Skulled players. In this case it breaks and is not lootable.\nPremium players can sell them to Free Account players who can not get all five blessings, for a higher price, because only Eremo sells them. They can be bought and looted on Hardcore PvP game worlds since Update 8.53.\nThis amulet replaced the Amulet of Life, which would shield both skills and items from loss.\nIt was also possible to obtain in a Red Surprise Bag during Tibia's 10th Anniversary and Tibia's 15th Anniversary celebrations.",

        "notes": "Notes\nThis item can be obtained by using The Cobra Amulet on an Intricate Cobra Shrine located inside a hidden crypt north of Ankrahmun. The crypt can be accessed by using a Shovel here. When this item was released, its creator Lionet explained what's behind its story:\n\nI really appreciate the interest of the Tibia Community in our lore and stories! Here are some additional notes on my story of Scarlett and Galthen:\nThe Cobra amulet is an extremely powerful artifact with an unknown origin as of now. Its traits are concentrated on a single individual but the curse will affect all things directly connected to the amulet and its wearer. When the amulet is returned to its eternal resting place, everything the taker, thus owner, of the amulet has experienced from that point in time onward will be undone. All of this, as already mentioned, will only affect events in direct relation to the bearer of the amulet and the bearer him- or herself.\nIn the case of Scarlett and Galthen, Scarlett was blinded towards Galthen while in turn a successful search for Scarlett was impeded by the amulet. Returning it to its resting place will alter the timeline for Scarlett (and also Galthen who is directly connected to the Scarlett, the amulet and ultimately the curse). So in their world, the events after the crypt never took place. Everything before that will still have happened. However, without the power of the Cobra, Scarlett will not continue the assassin path much further and she, as well as Galthen, will have the possibility to find each other. Both their searches would eventually be successful as they belong together.\nBy chosing to return the amulet, players are effectively building a somewhat happy ending for the two but will lose the amulet. That is why the note says: \"You are truly selfless\".",
