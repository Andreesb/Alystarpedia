When you move it to your ring slot, you will receive 200 damage (will be less if wearing equipment), but if you do it while standing in a protection zone you won't take any damage, once you've put it on you don't have to take it off for it to recharge. When it depletes for one day, you might get Poisoned or Cursed. When you get cursed, you'll get the following message: You are cursed by The Noxious Spawn!. If it happens you receive around 15 turns of damage, increasing from 1 until the last damage of 662+ (remove the curse eating a Hydra Tongue Salad or asking for healing in a temple). When it happens, the message about the claw being usable only for levels 100+ disappears and the claw can't be put in ring slot (becomes a decoration object). It recharges in about 24 hours. Note that the 24 hour recovery time counts down only when the item is \"active\" i.e. it will not count down in your depot unless you stand on the depot tile, nor will it recover in your inventory if you are offline; keeping it in a house is the better option as it will take the least amount of time. You could also carry 2 or more claws and switch when one depletes.\nWhen you wear it, it will say \"It tightens around your wrist as you take it on.\" and also \"Ouch! The serpent claw stabbed you.\"\nAfter getting cursed by a Claw of 'The Noxious Spawn' you will receive the achievement Cursed!.",

It reduces your shielding by 10 points and has energy for 7 minutes 30 seconds. Quite valued on the market nowadays since they can be used as quest items and useful in wars because of its death protection. Using a death ring when your shield skill is originally 10, it is reduced down to 0. It's also worth mentioning that even though shield is reduced by 10 levels, your shielding skill won't go up faster. The value of the ring decreased after Christmas Update 2007 because since then it is obtainable from quests. The attributes are only shown when worn.\nTwo of them are needed for the Dreamer's Challenge Quest.One can be obtained in the Into the Bone Pit Quest.Another can be obtained every year at Lightbearer event.",

Thus, taking the ring off after you have killed all drunkenness-causing creatures will still render your character incapacitated.\nIn addition to the loot from various creatures, they can also be found inside Usable crates that are around Thais, Yalahar and Edron.\nCan be acquired by completing the Geomancer Quest, Waterfall Quest, Skull of Ratha Quest and Triangle Tower Quest.",

There is a chance of dying in the process. This chance is exactly the same as the chance of success, so they're both 50%. It's important to know that if you die, you will lose all of your blessings except Twist of Fate as an ordinary PvE death and the String of Mending will also be destroyed.\nThe ring is a Prime Artefact and can be used to color a Cloth Fragment (Ring).\nWhen trying to create this ring, you will always receive the following messages:\nThe smooth string of mending coils around your whole arm as if it was to devour it.\nThe ring feels quite heavy now. Nothing else happens.\nThe ring feels even heavier. You feel slightly stronger, however.\nYou feel better, more energetic than ever before. The ring seems to wrap itself tighter around your finger.\nThe ring now cuts your flesh. However, you feel fast as lightning and strong as a dragon, fires seem to burn within you.\nYou feel as if you could touch the stars and see beyond even the dimmest of them. The ring hurts you now.\nThe ring now seems to be as hot as fire while at the same time cold as ice. Put it off or it will seriously hurt you.\nPain is no word for what you feel anymore. If you do not put the ring off it MAY kill you. Chances are 50/50.\nYour pain transports you in a different world, you are alone there. Filled with anguish. You may live or it MAY KILL YOU.\nYou became pain itself. You are mere seconds away from death. If you do not PUT OFF THE RING. You MAY actually DIE.\nThe last message, however, depends on your fate.\nMessage upon death: A bright explosion bursts from inside the ring. You die.\nMessage upon succeeding: The ring closes.
