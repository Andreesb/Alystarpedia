Their damage output is about the same as that of a bolt. Paladins can create 8 of them with the Conjure Explosive Arrow spell. A player with a Black Skull cannot use Burst Arrows. May be useful for paladins who fight creatures which come in packs, as it has a 100% hit rate to a direct target, and may still deal damage to nearby foes. This has its consequences, too, as in PvP worlds the burst arrow will hit players even if the paladin doesn't mean to.\nDuring big team hunts in Hardcore PvP worlds, Paladins can attack their tank to do 9 square meters of damage to all surrounding monsters in case they are unable to use Diamond Arrows or they simply don't have enough of them.",

The damage reduction from each creature's armor value produces variation in the damages so it's not likely that the energy damage component will equal the physical damage component.\nUsing elemental arrows is situational. An obvious use case is against creatures that are immune to physical damage. However, higher level paladins are likely to avoid these creatures because their primary damage output is still physical. Low level paladins may consider elemental arrows because they offer more damage than the other store-bought arrows. The Arrow offers 25 attack while the elemental arrows offer 28 (14 + 14). In addition, half of the damage will be in another element which may improve the damage.\nAnother option is to use Burst Arrows, which offer 27 attack and have no level requirement. Burst Arrows cannot miss their target and they may also hit a nearby creature. As a downside, Burst Arrows cannot be bought in stores and must be bought from players or obtained from e.g. Dragons.\n\n See also: Flaming Arrow, Earth Arrow, and Shiver Arrow  \n50 of them can be obtained through the Tower Defence Quest.",
