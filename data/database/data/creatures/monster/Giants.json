Sorcerers can cast a DoT spell such as Curse, followed by going down again is a good idea since the behemoth does not heal. Frequently recasting such a spell when the damage is down to 10 per round can kill the behemoth in about 5-10 minutes without putting yourself in too much danger.\nKnights can solo hunt Behemoths at level 200+ with an ice weapon such as Winterblade with relative ease and profit as Behemoths are weak to ice damage and otherwise resistant to physical damage. Using Summon Skullfrost when hunting Behemoths is very effective as they are weak to both ice and death damage.",

They are usually calm, but their fellow cyclopes train and condition them in order to ensure that their passive attitude changes quickly when facing one of the 'lesser' races. Conditioned Cyclops Drones usually attack on sight. Fortunately, they hardly seem to understand what they are doing and therefore rarely use the full strength of their imposing arms. Still, the sheer force of a thoughtless blow can crush bones and break weapons and armour. Cyclops Drones are not numerous, and as they are also not much valued among the cyclops, they are usually found deep underground working under supervision of other cyclops.",

Far to the north where it is cold enough to freeze even air, this race has its original home. In ancient times, when the gods waged war on each other, the world climate was shifting often. At this time, some tribes of the Frost Giants wandered to the south, following the biting cold and expanding their territory. Entire kingdoms crumbled under their feet.The Frost Giants became the ruler of the frozen waste and their icy kingdom grew every day. One day though, the seemingly eternal winter ended. Temperatures were rising again and most Frost Giants fled to the northern home of their ancestors. However, some of them became trapped on their retreat, cut off by the ocean that once used to be a frozen surface which could easily be crossed. Many of those unlucky Frost Giants perished either by the warm temperatures or by enemies who easily overwhelmed them in their weak condition. Some, however, were able to find refuge at places just cold enough to sustain their existence.Still those places are not well suited as they are much too warm for Frost Giants. Cut off from the northern Frost Giant civilisation and living in an inhospitable environment, the Frost Giants are known for their bad temper. Their sole joy seems to be to make other beings feel even more miserable than they do feel themselves. So they enjoy hunting, torturing or just smashing other creatures. Given this attitude, it's not surprising that the Frost Giants, though considerably intelligent, won't waste much time in parleying. If there is a chance to fight, they are using it. Frost Giants are extremely possessive and they fiercely defend their grounds against all intruders.",

        "notes": "The discovery of the Hulking Prehemoth sent shockwaves through the entire scientific community. Especially it's unique bone structure turned many things taken for granted upside down. Many of the bones that were found in the deepest caves and the bowels of Tibia, for years have been assumed to be the fossilized remains of the modern Behemoths. Yet the recent discoveries in Gnomprona now hint that they rather belonged to the Hulking Prehemoths that once seemed to have roamed the whole depths of Tibia. It now seems likely that the Hulking Prehemoths arose in times when food was abundant in their native underground habitat. Later when such sources of nourishment became scarce, they were slowly replaced by their more specialised mineral-eating children. Unlike his descendant the ordinary Behemoth, who adapted mostly to a diet of minerals, the primal ancestor relies on a diet of flesh and bones. Some point out that their digesting of creatures as a whole ultimately enabled their offspring's adaption to a diet of minerals. As such scientists point out the difference of bones and minerals seems minor.\nIn Gomprona the Hulking Prehemoth is a comparatively peaceful creature. Though perfectly able to hunt for the bone and marrow it needs, it's relatively docile when well-fed. Yet given their sheer mass and muscle in fact they are rarely if ever well-fed aside from the controlled environment of captured Hulking Prehemoths. All attempts to tame the creatures resulted in utter and sometimes fatal failure so the gnomes gave up on wasting valuable crystals on such endeavours. The area that currently houses operation challenger has been cut off from the main island by a relatively new lava stream. Said area seemingly was the breeding and hatching ground of the local Prehemoths population and it has yet to be seen how the Hulking Prehemothes adapt to this - or if the lava foreshadowed their inevitable extinction. As for now the Hulking Prehemoth population has suffered and competing creatures prospered, but slowly the number of Behemoth's seem to be stabilising and reaching a new equilibrium.",

        "notes": "Ogres are large, downright monstrous in appearance, considerably dwarfing even tall orcs. They have a plump, corpulent body, chunky hands and feet and a small, seemingly neckless head. An average adult ogre stands over twelve feet tall, and his waist circumference is almost the half of his height. Most ogres are bald and only rarely have facial hair. They use wooden clubs as weapons, banded, studded or spiked with iron; but stone hatchets or fork-like weapons are also common. While missile combat with bows or crossbows is too difficult for them, they are good at throwing heavy things, particularly boulders. They mature more quickly than humans, reaching adulthood at the age of twelve. Ogres live in tribes that inhabit the steppe and grassland of Krailos, for the most part dwelling in big leather tents or stone huts, though some ogre tribes still have nomadic tendencies. Leader of a tribe is usually the strongest male ogre. The chieftain is supported by an ogre-shaman. If the shaman is female, the two are often, but not necessarily, a couple. The chieftain is responsible for all decisions concerning the hunt and martial matters while the shaman is responsible for all affairs spiritual and social. Although the ogres are a warlike, often brutal people, they are mostly interested in good food rather than in anything else. Ogres worship the Great Hunger, a kind of spirit being they believe will eat up the entire world if not fed regularly. Therefore they often perform rites of sacrifice (of food and of living creatures) to feed this entity. Most male ogres come in two varieties, brutes and savages. Their main task is to fight for the clan or to scout the steppe for something edible. Ogre brutes specialise in hurling boulders and brute force, punching and crushing their enemy with their enormous body weight. Sometimes, however, they may also carry a single large club or heavy axe for emphasis.",

They have a plump, corpulent body, chunky hands and feet and a small, seemingly neckless head. An average adult ogre stands over twelve feet tall, and his waist circumference is almost the half of his height. Most ogres are bald and only rarely have facial hair. They use wooden clubs as weapons, banded, studded or spiked with iron; but stone hatchets or fork-like weapons are also common. While missile combat with bows or crossbows is too difficult for them, they are good at throwing heavy things, particularly boulders. They mature more quickly than humans, reaching adulthood at the age of twelve. Ogres live in tribes that inhabit the steppe and grassland of Krailos, for the most part dwelling in big leather tents or stone huts, though some ogre tribes still have nomadic tendencies. Leader of a tribe is usually the strongest male ogre. The chieftain is supported by an ogre-shaman. If the shaman is female, the two are often, but not necessarily, a couple. The chieftain is responsible for all decisions concerning the hunt and martial matters while the shaman is responsible for all affairs spiritual and social. Although the ogres are a warlike, often brutal people, they are mostly interested in good food rather than in anything else. Ogres worship the Great Hunger, a kind of spirit being they believe will eat up the entire world if not fed regularly. Therefore they often perform rites of sacrifice (of food and of living creatures) to feed this entity. Most male ogres come in two varieties, brutes and savages. Their main task is to fight for the clan or to scout the steppe for something edible. Ogre savages favour fang-like weapons, like short swords made of stone, axes of crude iron or clubs carved out of animal horn. No less dangerous than the brutes, most ogre savages prefer weapons with an edge or blade over a club - the better to slice their enemy's belly or to bleed and weaken their fleeing prey. They love to mince their food, and taunt enemies with war cries that hint at the meashed meal the foe will be turned into. ",

So there is no shared experience between the summon and its summoner, like with the normal Summon Creature spell. It will follow players at their speed and will go up and down stairs and holes with them. It lasts for 15 minutes with a 30 minutes cooldown. It can go with you to a Protection Zone.

Due to its timer/cooldown mechanic, you cannot have 100% uptime of it, so it's important to beware when it's about to disappear as all creatures will change target. Since it's main function is to act like a blocker, it's not recommended to use it when hunting with a Knight as it will Challenge the creatures away from him, reducing the knight's damage output. Learning how to manage the summon can be tricky at first, as you cannot force it to cast its challenge spell. You should be prepared to block the creatures you're going to fight for a few turns until the Sorcerer Familiar challenges them, since its spell use is quite erratic. Similarly, it's possible that it doesn't use the spell for a few seconds, allowing the creatures to retarget. An important strategy when using the Sorcerer Familiar to block several creatures is to always change your target to the creature that will die last, because if the Sorcerer Familiar doesn't have a target it will run back to its master, bringing the creatures its blocking with it. At higher levels, the Sorcerer Familiar is used mostly in emergencies to Challenge creatures that are trapping another player or yourself. This however isn't always effective as the summon dies very quickly to strong creatures and may not even use the Challenge spell before that.",
