        "description": "Highly destructive and corrosive, the Acid Blob has little in common with the ordinary slime. They are much better in finding and pursuing a target than their distant cousins. While the ordinary slime is driven by the primal urge to get food, the Acid Blob is out for destruction. It is indeed a frightening sight when a bunch of these creatures crawls towards a single target with the intention to completely destroy it.\nSome researchers speculate that Acid Blobs share their intelligence with blobs all over the world. As Acid Blobs reproduce themselves by splitting into two entities, this thesis might have an element of truth.\nBe it as it may, the Acid Blob is a constant threat particularly to the environment. Since living creatures are often smart and quick enough to avoid the attacks of the blobs, any kind of  plants,  constructions and the like are usually not that lucky and are annihilated by their attacks.\nIn the past, some eccentric madmen used Acid Blobs as waste disposal, which was considered to be somewhat stylish. However, after the Acid Blobs had digested a certain amount of waste, they started reproducing themselves multiple times which started to become a real problem. After several unpleasant incidents, this way of waste disposal was stopped, however, the results of such folly can still be seen at various places.",

Goannas lay eggs in a nest or burrow, but sometimes also inside termite mounds, which offers protection as well as incubation. Additionally, the termites provide a meal for the young as they hatch. Goanna eggs are a sought after meal for the human population of Kilmaresh. But as getting them is a dangerous task, they make a rather expensive menu. \n\nGoannas are found throughout the steppes of Kilmaresh. They prey on insects, smaller lizards, snakes, birds, mammals and also humans if they have the chance to do so. But they are also eaters of carrion and thus attracted to rotting meat. There's a debate whether goannas are venomous or not. It is a fact that goanna bites cause incessant bleeding and many sages assume that this is because of toxin-producing glands in the lizards' mouth.",

        "description": "The afflicted striders are purposely infected with a rare parasite that significantly alters their physiology and psyche. It mainly seems to make them more aggressive and physically capable, though it also significantly reduces their life span. Those Below always showed little restraint in using such methods in disregard of their minions but such tactics and with them the deployment of afflicted striders have become more common recently. This might hint at a shift of leadership or strategy.\nThe afflicted striders behave even more violently und unforeseeable under the influence of the parasites, yet they seem strangely more prone to acts of violence aimed purposely to be discarded as the effect of raised aggression. The suggestion that the tiny parasites are raising the striders intelligence or are intelligent themselves and acting on purpose seems a bit farfetched though. A more recent theory suggests that the parasites make the striders more susceptible to the influence of creatures such as the feared brainstealer. This would explain their existence in certain battle forces while they are lacking in others. A further, more daring theory even suggests that the small parasites are part of a hive mind and that there is one or more master parasites hidden in the depths of Those Below territory that mastermind their control. This would still leave unexplained why they are spread amongst forces in such unequal manner and the efficiency of said method would be questionable at best. Even the inflicted striders are obviously only beasts that primarily follow their basic impulses and don't express any higher strategy of some kind. Still they are a dangerous foe and even disjointed from any army are a threat to any area that they are encountered in.\nThough the parasites seem only to infest striders, everyone who loots items from such a creature should clean them thoroughly.",

These creations can vary greatly in size and complexity, depending on their purpose and desired effect. Intricate pieces of jewellery, figurines and ornaments are among them as well as charming and colourful dresses and apparel. You search for an elegant gown made entirely of candy floss, embroidered with sugary sprinkles? Tiny candy stars strung together on dainty chains to create a playful necklace?

Unspectacular and not sentient on their own, they are mere tools for powerful magicians. There are rumours, though, of ancient feathers that copied so many arcane texts, that some of the knowledge gradually accumulated in them. Slowly but steadily they grow in power and sentience. Eventually they acquired some sort of self awareness. Becoming less of a tool and more of a being, they grew less useful for their original purpose. At some point they are pulled from their copy duties and act more like librarians. Their main function becomes to contain dangerous knowledge with the use of their acquired skills in glyphs and wards. Still they are obsessed with their original purpose and copy random books in their spare time, accumulating more and more knowledge in the process. They are highly skilled in the use of arcane sigils but in the time of need and urgency they rather employ spontaneous bursts of the magic they acquired. Even when protecting themselves or their libraries, they still act more like emotionless constructs reacting on a more practical base. Their fighting style might also best be described as 'efficient'. It takes an extremely long time for an animated feather to display some kind of personality. Most perish to the teeth of time and accidents. The few that endure can become quite intelligent, even quirky. Rumour has it, that a few feathers authored books on their own, not even just compiled knowledge they acquired but genuinely new and creative works with astounding insights. At least one extremely old animated feather chose to author books of comedic limericks while another specialized on acclaimed love poems.",

It was the arachnophobica who put an end to most of them. It's a mute point to argue if the arachnophobica is a twisted form of giant spider, an enlarged and mutated common spider or was born out of subconscious fears. What matters is, that the nightmare created a ferocious beast that seems to feed on the fears but also the lifeblood of its victims. Albeit capable of weaving webs, the archanophobica rarely bothers to do so and rather relies on its speed and lethal strength. In its hunting behavior the beast displays an unnerving amount of cunning and malice. It's able to prepare an ambush and prepare its attacks with others of its kind. It also seems to enjoy the fear of its victims and is known to play vile games of cat and mouse with a prey, often relying on a series of vicious, power draining attacks rather then an early finishing blow. It mercilessly weeds out all the misshapen and weaker creatures born of the nightmare and in the long run may enforce an unnatural selection of the nightmare-born, that will lead to generations of even more vicious creatures, if the said nightmare can't be stopped. The only positive thing that might be said about this disgusting abomination is, that its brutal viciousness does not even stop at their own kind and the hatching of a batch of arachnophobica eggs is an orgy of slaughter and cannibalism that only a few of them survive - often only to be devoured by their parents.",

Due to seismic activity their natural habitat was destroyed, but they managed to escape into an underground tunnel that had opened up. In the new environment they were able to escape their natural predators more easily and had less competition for nourishment. And so they prospered and became a plague for the depths of the earth, mainly invading gnomish holdings for their abundance of what the armadile consider food. As omnivores the armadile are a nuisance when encountered alone, but a threat when run into in greater numbers. Not only do they attack other creatures to devour them or destroy their food sources, their aimless digging and mineral eating often completely destroys the stability of caves and tunnels. Since there are no means to drive the Armadile out, the only solution is to exterminate them or to abandon areas with severe Armadile infestation. The main approach to identify natural competitors or threats to the Armadile have yet to meet with success. It is likely that whatever scares the Armadile off will probably be even worse itself.",

Regarded by their tribesmen as beings touched by divinity, there is little that could restrain them.

With some training they are able to conjure some animal spirits and lead them into battle. Even though their magical abilities are quite limited, they can also use their powers in several destructive ways to defend themselves. Under the shaman queen, it has become more and more common that only shamans utterly loyal to her receive a formal and extensive training. For this reason the ranks of the Barbarian Brutetamers have been boosted with some truly gifted women who will probably never be able to use the full power of their potential.

Those who are deemed unworthy have to atone for their failure by becoming second line support fighters and engaging an enemy from a distance. Only if their superiors see them fight recklessly, they might return to the ranks of the true warriors. Given the fact that distance fighting is seen as dishonourable, those barbarians have a hard time to get accepted by the tribe again. Seen as dispensable, other tribesmen do little to defend the distance fighters when they become cornered.

Under the guidance of their shaman queen, it has become of little importance if this skull belongs to an animal or to a human opponent. In holy ceremonies the young barbarians are allowed to add their most worthy trophies to the holy skull collection of their tribe. It is the ultimate goal of all initiates to achieve a higher status by gaining more and more worthy offerings. For this reason, the youngsters are eager to go on a hunt or into a battle likewise. The Barbarian Skullhunters of varied ranks are the most numerous force among the barbarians. They can be found in hunting parties almost everywhere on the Ice Islands.

The impressive creatures are a subspecies of the Anuma, magical beasts that inhabit the continent Kilmaresh and were created by the sun gods Suon and Fafnar.\n\nIt is said that the entire continent was once given to them by the gods. But the Anuma conferred the dominance over Kilmaresh to the humans, in an effort to let them take responsibility of their own. However, after the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar and the cataclysm that severed the continent, the Anuma took the reign over Kilmaresh back - for the humans' own benefit as they said.\n\nIt is told that the bashmu were created when some of Fafnar's tears fell into the sea. At first they lived beneath the waves but as they owe their existence to a goddess of sun and heat, they were soon drawn to the hot and dry steppes of Kilmaresh. Yet they missed the salt they got accustomed to in the waters of the ocean. This is the reason why the bashmu retreated to places where they could find natural deposits of salt, mainly subterranean caves. There, the halophilic creatures subsist on the deposited salt veins and eat them up entirely before moving to other habitats. Rumour has it that the most powerful bashmu have seven tongues, eight arms and four wings. As of yet, nobody has ever seen such kind of bashmu, so it remains unclear whether they really exist.",

Many guardian creatures were prototyped but none could impress the collective of librarians who always favoured only their own creations. Finally one of them tasked nightmares and other demons to search the fringes of the subconsciousnesses of dreaming librarians for what scared them most. The amalgam of their loot was condensed into the form of the biting book. The librarians recognized what has been done there and reluctantly agreed that this creation would suit the role fine. In the centuries since then, many of the biting books were created and trained by their new masters. Indeed they act like some sort of dog and can be sometimes even playful with their owner. Still they are dangerous beasts and excellent companions as well as guardians for the libraries. They are resilient, never sleep and despite their appearance have keen senses. They can feel the slightest vibrations of the floor, their eyes are able to see in the spectrum of magic and their tongue is able to pick up smells from miles away. They are shrewd and aggressive fighters, albeit on a primal level and they are fiercely loyal to their master. Still a few of their kind proved too aggressive for training or went mad by mistreatment. Those were chained to walls to provide a scary obstacle for intruders. The biting books only major flaw is their diet which consists of ill-written stories and poetry.",

        "description": "The blemished spawn breeds in the most hostile and toxic environment to be encountered in the Tibian depths. The sulphurous chasms that are their habitat are rarely contested by other creatures so they can multiply in numbers that seem to concern even their masters below. The nests of the blemished spawns are often hit by exterminations by the forces of Those Below to keep their numbers somewhat in check. Seemingly some of the actions and expansions of Those Below in the past heavily disrupted the subterranean ecosystem and made the somewhat rare breed of chasm spawns an environmental hazard. It has yet to be seen how this hazard can be contained, if at all. With seemingly endless numbers of blemished spawns at hand, it seems obvious that some effort has to be put into turning them into a manageable army, else their presence on the battlefields would certainly be more prevalent. Still they are as unpredictable and destructive as the areas they use to dwell in. Only male specimens are taken into the hordes to prevent them from producing unmanageable offspring. In some rare occasions some blemished spawns are deployed in hostile territory to build colonies and multiply. In doing so their handlers hope to soften up resistance, slow down and disrupt hostile operations or make areas uninhabitable. Yet the blemished spawns are drawn to their toxic habitat and tend to leave if any more appropriate lair is around. Also outside their toxic habitat their reproduction rate and activity slows down more and more over time. So such tactics have proven ineffective and desperate at best. A new and alarming new theory of the renowned gnomish scientist Gnomespiracy sees a connection of chasm spawns and blemished spawns to the hive. The implications of such a connection would be devastating and put the identity of Those Below into a new light. As a source for such theories, Gnomespiracy has until now only cited dubious and unverifiable reports. Still, this theory has spread through the more uneducated communities like a wildfire and found many believers that claim that the authorities are supressing the truth.",

        "description": "Another phenomenon attributed to the infamous necromantic smog of Rathleton is the existence of the blood beast. As hideous and disgusting as these creatures are, the secret of their creation is even more disturbing. It seems sometimes decaying corpses of animals become that imbued with the unstable necromantic residue, that their carrion blood becomes the carrier of some dark force when it somehow reacts with glooth. This blood behaves almost as sentient. It is known to creep around and even hide itself. It's searching for more blood, changed like itself and through metaphysical means is obviously able to sense it. Over time more and more of this mix of blood and glooth finds together, building sometimes enormous pools in underground caverns. Those pools act like a beacon for the spirits of predatory animals that died in pain and anger. If such a creature comes close to the pool a part of it splits and devours the spirit, becoming a separate entity on its own. The so created creature knows only the basest and cruellest instincts of the beasts. With a malleable body of soiled glooth and unclean blood it follows the needs of a predator. The blood beast lurks or hunts like ordinary animals would do, but it reveals a cunning beyond that of animals and a cruelty that is frightening. It is unknown if the creature actually needs food or at least has to replenish blood by its kills. The blood beast was immortalised by Hainnbert Shuckletons novel 'The beast from the shadows' which spread knowledge of these creatures throughout the world and painted a mostly false and overly romantic and tragic picture of the cruel predator. Rumours attribute the blood beast all kinds of unverified abilities like flowing beneath doors or through wall cracks or wall crawling and even lurking on ceilings. Most of this misleading information is spread by novels that tried to copy Shuckletons success and lead to the demise of more than one know-it-all adventurer. To complicate things even furthers there actually IS evidence to support some of the wilder claims made about the abilities of the creature. For instance it is extremely probable that the blood beast can reform itself after being slain. If it is via sentient blood creeping all their way to its spawning pool to be reborn or somehow else, there is proof that victorious blood beast slayers was attacked at his home, often in sleep by a blood beast that showed disturbing knowledge of its victims combat tactics. The gravest danger though is to dismiss the existence of these creatures as purely fiction and be utterly unprepared to encounter one.   ",

Sometimes they wait motionlessly for a victim to approach, a strategy which works quite well because their shells can easily be mistaken for stones. It is rumoured that from time to time the quara tame Blood Crabs and use them as watchdogs, but since none of them was ever seen in a raid, this rumour is not confirmed yet.",

Rumours have it that blood hands have artificially enhanced blood in their veins, making them ruthless tools that do the bidding of their masters. \nBlood hands are named after the red gloves they wear, but the name is not merely a metaphor: blood hands have to pass several years of training and killing in the field to prove worthy of ascending into the ranks of the priests. Though the initiation takes place behind securely closed doors, there are hints of blood rage visions, brain washing, grotesque rituals and blood transfusions during the final trial, and only those who live through these ordeals are entitled to call themselves blood priests, and receive a new name. Blood hands are often sent abroad to fulfil a mission of their master's or assisting him, and may return with strange devices, samples and stains. On the upside, blood hands are also skilled surgeons, and many an unhappy necromancer has relied on their skill to prolong his life or sew a limb back on, even if he had to pledge his services to theirs in return.\nIn combat, blood hands use what their masters have taught them, and summon minions they managed to pressure into a blood bond, which usually means fellow necromancers who owed them a favour or two.

Blood priests devote their lives to the study of blood and so-called lesser fluids. They attribute the most stupefying qualities to blood, and experiment extensively with it, using strange devices in their blood hall caverns. This requires a constant supply of fresh fluids and bodies and therefore blood priests and their henchmen are avoided even by their fellow Dark Summoners for fear of their lives. Even their names reflect their love for everything associated with blood and it is said they do not exactly dye their robes blood red. \nBlood Priests love extravaganza in speech and habit, but they also favour symmetrical shapes and figures - nets, crosses, or abstract tree shapes - shapes that favour a flow and distribution of fluids. Their single-minded extravaganza extends to their love for other species as well. Though rats are usually preferred animals of Urgith and abound in Drefia, blood priests dote on bats, ticks and leeches, and it is even rumoured they have some kind of agreement with the vampires - though nobody dares to imagine to what purpose, and certainly will not ask.",

They contaminate the environment by spreading their fear and desperation, and they bind rotten plants to the bones of their mortal remains.

However, their mad and frightening wailing warns all creatures of their approach. Hungry for life, Bog Raiders attack every living being that crosses their way, vainly trying to gain their enemy's life force to satisfy their tormenting hunger.

        "description": "Bonelords are members of an ancient race that once ruled vast parts of the world. The days of this ancient glory are long gone but unlike other races of the past, the Bonelords managed to survive the decline of their power. Parts of their former power exist along with small groups or loners who took refuge in some ruins or caves. Some reluctantly allied themselves with other races or enslaved weaker creatures to do their bidding. Using bribes or threats, some overlords managed to hire Bonelords into their rank. Such 'labour contracts' are only temporary at best and chances are that a Bonelord is more concerned about plotting revenge or betrayal on its 'master' than to do his bidding.\nBonelords are accomplished magicians of great intellect. The latter is rather alien to human standards and it is not easy to understand a Bonelord's motivations and philosophy. With their natural affinity to the necromantic arts, the Bonelords still claim some areas of land as their own and guard them with the help of their undead minions. They are hostile to most other races which they consider as upstarts and primitive. They fiercely defend their realms or places they claim for their own, and their interest in fresh corpses for their necromantic studies makes them a threat for each human community. Since their population grows only slowly, they envy and hate the more fertile races which, in their eyes, stole the power that rightfully belonged to the Bonelords. Seeing themselves as a superior 'conqueror race', they gather their undead forces and pursue their studies aiming at the day on which they will raise an unstoppable army of powerful undead creatures to lead them to another war to conquer the world.",

        "description": "The bony sea devil is truly an amalgam of souls of the drowned. It's a shared and traumatic fear given form by extreme maddened emotions. The sea devils hunger for more such fear and are drawn to the poor souls that might share it. By devouring them, they gain more and more power and solidity until they reach their final form that can be encountered by travellers in Zarganash. Yet they won't stop there of course and continue to devour more and more souls of the drowned which makes then fat and bloated eventually. Though consisting of the souls of the drowned or lost at sea, they don't shy other entities, living or dead. In fact living beings seem to be special morsels for this ravenous creatures. When they acquired enough such spiritual energy, they retreat to the depths of Zarganash, where they split in halve. In that way they can actually reproduce. It can be assumed that there was a first bony sea devil that was the progenitor of these creatures that share his form. If and where this creature still exists is subject to whispered legends amongst the otherwise jaded travellers of this deepest level of the netherworld. As long as the bony sea devils are around it seems unlikely enough souls of the drowned will find together to form another progenitor with different qualities and appearance, but it can't be ruled out. How the sea devils will react to such a competition is yet to be seen. Strangely enough the usually not very social sea devils are very protective towards bloated sea devils that are soon splitting. It is assumed that this behaviour is a distant remnant of their life in the physical world, yet since there is no such a thing as pregnancy amongst fish it still seems somewhat curious and might hint at something else entirely. Since they heavily rely on the souls of the drowned, there is a rumour that the sea devils get agitated even days before a great storm is boiling up in the realms of the living. On the other hand this might be Zarganash's equivalent of sailor's yarn.",

Other than pixies, nymphs or fauns they favour underground caves and tunnels over forests or lush meadows. Only at night, they are roaming the surface, chasing other fae and visitors to Feyrist alike. Boogies devour smaller animals like squirrels, rabbits or badgers but on the quiet the fae tell that they also feed on fairies or pookas if they catch them. As the fae emerge from mortals' pleasant dreams the boogies don't really fit into the mould. In fact they were once clumsy yet peaceful fae, but they are now twisted and tainted by a mysterious, sinister force that is threatening Feyrist as well as the rest of Tibia.

        "description": "Brachiodemons are battle-hardened demons that were chosen by their vile masters to invade Zarganash for their adaptability. After untold time in Zarganash only the most adaptive of these creatures survived, but not unscarred. Zarganash has changed then permanently, trapping them for all eternity and binding their essence to the realm itself. Their self-awareness became bound to the essence of the plane in a twisted way. Should their material form ever be destroyed a gruesome fate of eternal torment awaits their consciousness. Forever will they ride helplessly with the storms and currents of Zarganash to be grinded down and reconstructed constantly. A fact they are aware of all to well, which makes them fight for their lives even more fiercely and desperately. Though the inner torment that is prevalent in Zarganash has already took deep roots in their essence and inherently changed them, some of them might still half-heartedly do the biddings of their demonic masters but they do so only out of an attitude of resignation and habit that grows more and more distant over time. In truth for a long time they have already given in to the despair and atrophy that permeates the realm and unknowingly became agents of the powers behind the curtains of Zarganash. While most of them are unknowingly doing the bidding of the pale worm and spread its taint wherever they go, they still think of themselves as free beings and would actively fight the worm and its minions. The subtle strings that the worm and others use on them usually prevent them from coming anywhere near the true plots that are played out in Zarganash. How much resistance against the will of the pale worm a brachiodemon could muster varies probably highly from individual to individual but the worm will always win in the long run.",

Since they are also the most often encountered outside of their home territory, the whole telepathic race has often mistakenly been coined as brain squids. Their purpose is to form a telepathic network that processes information and commands for others of their race. The exchange between individuals intensifies due to proximity and if enough brain squids are close enough to each other, they become a collective entity that overrides each individual. The thoughts of other, 'lesser' members of their species in the vicinity are shut down and they only function as mere extensions and tools of the collective. With the help of the luminous squid cast, they are even able to control the minds of weak willed individuals of other species and make them do their bidding. Like others of their race, they follow the teaching of Zathroth in their own, twisted ways and can sometimes be found amongst other followers of their god. Whether they serve as spies, watchmen or advisors is hard to tell. It is them who create the extreme breeding programmes of their species. If the need arises they come up with a new caste to fit into any new position and initiate the breeding processes that might require much time and many generations to come to pass. This makes the race as a whole somewhat inflexible and dependent on allies. Their inbreed disdain for other races that follow no breeding procedures at all makes it hard for them to find any allies. This lead to their sorcerer class to form pacts with demons and heavy reliance on the assistance by the cult of Zathroth. In turn they provide the cult with capable overseers and fighters, when the need arises and it is said that if that is the case, there is secret breed at their disposal which could prove devastating to their opponents or enemies of Zathroth.",

        "description": "Some of the most ancient bonelords have gained so much power over undeath that they cross the margin between life and death. What might be considered the transformation of a living being into one of the dreaded liches, turns into something very sinister. Neither alive nor truly dead, they dwell on the border of two realms. Having mastered unspeakable techniques and twisted their own minds in ways unfathomable for other beings, they 'broke' something in their minds or rather in their souls. The part that connects each and everything to the living world is not working right in these creatures. At this step other creatures would just turn mad or wither, but some of the ancient bonelords face another fate. Through sheer will and unthinkable understanding of the thin lines between life and death, they grasp to the concept of existence. Just like they once animated their undead minions, they now keep their decaying but not really dead bodies in motion. Parts of their twisted minds are forever trapped in the realm of the dead though, captured in a constant nightmare that slowly tries to erode their sanity. To prevent the drifting off in this dream of death, they have removed parts of their skull. This way they are able to constantly stimulate their own brains with jolts of energy from their eye stalks. In a magical surgery, they have added an eye-stalklike appendage and attached a stinger to their body. It is used to leech brain fluids from helpless victims to sustain their own existence. Their central eye is sealed shut to prevent any unnecessary distraction from their inward struggle. As the central eye is normally used for bonelord communication, the Braindeath has no way to communicate with other bonelords. It relies on verbal communication which makes it disgusting even for its own kind.\nTheir mastery of death makes them formidable opponents. Luckily, they do not often meddle with the affairs of the living. Those who for some reason cross the path of a Braindeath should be prepared for a tough fight. With little regard for its own life or that of any other being, the Braindeath will attack with an array of devastating powers that outshines every other bonelord. Commanding powerful minions from beyond the grave and possessing the resilience of undeath, a Braindeath is a nearly unstoppable force if not countered with the correct tactics.",

The environment of Zarganash, with is the complete antithesis to life, health and growth, immediately begins to twist and corrupt those spirits in body and mind. With alarming speed it moulds them into something far more sinister and dangerous. In a mockery of their former existence, they foster the growth of bleakness and of all things that carry the deathly taint of Zarganash. In a vague memory of their former existence they find purpose in a twisted form of the things that were once dear to them. Where they once fostered growth, they now shepherd the lost souls towards their inevitable doom and damnation. They do so without glee, though. For them they are just following a new found natural order that all things have to bow to. Where other creatures of Zarganash seem to enjoy the suffering and abandonment of hope, the branchy crawlers seemingly just gave in to their new existence with an overwhelming resignation that virtually begins to seep out of them. Though they might even be able to feel some form of pity towards their victims, they still show no remorse or restraint. If anything, they seem to experience overwhelming self-loathing. They carry with them blight and despair, eternally locking them out of everything that could have had any deeper meaning to them. They are barred of anything they once held dear. In yet another mockery of their former existence the branchy crawlers have odd regenerative abilities. Whenever they are destroyed their essence will reform into a new branchy crawler after a while. This form of immortality is yet only a curse to them, binding them eternally to the twisted form and existence that they hate. ",

When Ferumbras futile actions violated the boundaries between worlds, it was none of those abominations that slipped through first, but some natural, or rather unnatural, disaster. These beings, which do not possess any sentience, were driven by some sinister and destructive purpose. A prime example for such creatures is the Breach Brood.  \nThe Breach Brood can be best described as a force of destruction which has taken shape. It somehow interacts with its surroundings - usually in a brutal way. The Breach Brood seems even more unstable than others of its ilk; because of that it is unable to exists for a lengthy period of time outside the disruptive netherworld in which it spawned. It still strives towards its only purpose - the annihilation and consumption of reality. This is an enemy that can't be reasoned with, an enemy that knows no mercy and shows no mercy. Its whole existence is completely bound to nothing else than destruction. \nIts very existence already causes harm to our reality and its inhabitants. Its attacks can rather be compared to a fire burning a hand which accidentally happened to touch it than a planned move. Like a fire that burns straw but not stone, its actions are only expressions of itself and nothing more. Some assume that the Breach Brood and other beings from beyond are nothing more than the manifestation and with that part of the ultimate destruction all around them.\nTo conclude, the Breach Brood is a rather forceful foe that does not follow any form of battle plan.

It is argued whether this bug is the product of corruption or rather drawn to it. As a matter of fact the Brimstone Bug actually feeds on the corrupted essence of the world regardless of its source. They are drawn to places of dark magic or magical devastation. They are also known to devour residues of undead and demonic excrements without hesitation. Like certain flies are drawn to physically rotten things, the Brimstone Bug is attracted by things that are spiritually rotten. Not only does such matter no harm to them, it also seems to fuel several unusual powers of the Brimstone Bug. Only occasionally though, they display their magical powers which are unpredictable but harmful. Even though corruption is their preferred kind of nourishment, the Brimstone Bugs are not above attacking uncorrupted beings. If not starving, the bug will carry its dead or helpless prey to a place of great corruption and wait for the victim to become contaminated by the taint. Then it will finally devour it.\nBrimstone Bugs live in swarms of different sizes even though they are quite aggressive among each other and fights are common, brutal, and often lethal. The Brimstone Bug is cannibalistic and will devour any fallen swarm member. However, if they can choose, they will devour corrupted prey first, which makes those theories less likely which claim that the Brimstone Bug itself is a result of corruption.\nSometimes colonies of Brimstone Bugs form in seemingly uncorrupted areas. The truth is, however, that the bugs only eat the corruption faster than it can grow back. So exterminating a colony might prove even worse than the bugs itself because without the bugs the corruption might spread even further through the land.",

Constantly exuding a corrosive, salty sweat, these demons are unstoppable once set on a path of destruction.

        "description": "For a long time, the Broken Shapers were only a rare sight. They had been classified as a subspecies of the troglodytes, which are considered to be extinct nowadays. However, a recent breakthrough links the Broken Shapers with the once proud race of the Astral Shapers. It can only be speculated what this noble race had to endure to end like this.\nHaving lived hidden in underground caves for centuries, they have hardly anything in common with their ancestry anymore. They have turned into physically degenerated scavengers - one could even describe them as feral predators. These wretched creatures are primitive at best, very close to losing their mind completely and turning into mere animals. The hostile environment has turned them in a similarly hostile race. They know no mercy and consider intruders either as threat or prey. With hardly any resources at hand, the looting of slain prospectors or adventurers is very important for their kind.\nThe Broken Shapers seem magically attracted by places at which their power used to be strong many centuries ago. They look at the ruins left by their ancestors almost with religious reverence. Sometimes objects of the past replace idols or shrines in their rituals. Those who are slain and plundered by the Broken Shapers may consider themselves as lucky.  Less fortunate ones are dragged screaming into the Broken Shapers' lairs to 'participate' in gruesome rites in order to appease some ancient revered artefact.\nEven though the Broken Shapers tend to stick to certain territories if possible, they are also a cowardly race that will leave an encampment when threatened. Then they roam the depths of Tibia until they find another hideout. It is quite common that they keep sending back scouts for several generations to find out if their old territory is safe once more.\nThe Broken Shapers use only the most primitive tools and weapons, however, many of them are augmented with pieces of old Shaper equipment. The many centuries of unforgiving selection have turned the Broken Shapers into fierce fighters with lightning reflexes, surprisingly muscular bodies, paired with a desperate ferocity. Their senses have adapted to the subterranean environment which usually gives them an edge against intruders. However, they seem to avoid daylight and they appear to be afraid of fire and light spells.\nA lonely Broken Shaper will rather flee than fight. Only when they outnumber their opponent, they turn into quite fierce and aggressive fighters. As a whole the race with its few and splintered localised territories poses no big threat. They also seem to lack any ambitions. In these days in which the heritage of the Shapers gains more and more importance though, hostile encounters are increasing rapidly. ",

The Broodriders control their elders with surprising skill, directing them into battle while they themselves strike with precision and malice. Together, they form a chaotic but devastating force, capable of overwhelming even the most disciplined armies. In battle, the Broodrider is both a tactician and a berserker, using the brute strength of its mount to wreak havoc while scheming its next move.",

They view every product of the bulltaur's forges as a sacred gift, which they proudly display in the form of elaborate tattoos and the armor and weaponry worn. Despite their brutish nature, they are rather simple-minded and superstitious, often deferring to the wisdom of their elders and leaders, whom they blindly follow. This makes them easy targets for manipulations by priests and astrologers that use them as pawns in their power games. Their every action is governed by their unyielding belief in the divine origins of their forged equipment, making their use in war a sacred act, often accompanied by simple battle prayers. Some among their kind revere the occasional warrior saints, who scholars see as remnants of a long forgotten war-cult that was obliterated but not entirely erased when the Forge Cult claimed dominance.

Filled of what the gods opposing Zathroth and his allies would consider blasphemy and mockery of the godly order of things, these books have been given such a strong purpose that they unintentionally came to life. Burning not only with hell fire but also the desire to taint and burn everything that opposes Zathroth they are a common sight at places dedicated to him. The semi sentient books can't be controlled and so they are usually allowed to hover around, sniffing for all things that don't bear the mark of Zathroth. Sometimes, when a follower of Zathroth falls out of grace, they are the first to swarm him, attack him and ultimately incinerate him. Because of that faith trials are often held where many of the burning books made their lair. Though they technically intended with another, unknown sinister purpose, the sentience of the books had never stopped their production in the depth of hell. It is assumed that their production continues because they found their place and use despite being a failure. Other rumors though claim that only one burning masterbook was created at all and somewhere in the deepest, burning pits of hell this queen book still exists. Tended by an army of lower books, it spawns its burning breed with each beat of her burning heart.\nThe burning books themselves are highly attuned to fire and wield it as shield and weapon. It is remorseless in its cruelty and eager to destroy anything that might displease Zathroth. How these animalistic creatures determine the dedication of others and how accurate they might be remains a secret. The cynical followers of Zathroth don't mind either and gleefully watch even the downfall of one of their own, when the books decide someone earned Zathroth' wrath.",

However, there came a time when a group of Fafnar's adherers became more and more influential and aggressive until this sect postulated the sole worship of Fafnar. This resulted in a religious war between the Fafnar followers and those who fought for the duality of the two sun gods. Ultimately, the war was ended by a major natural disaster that split off the eastern peninsula from the western part of the land mass. This was interpreted as a demonstration of divine wrath. It was rumoured that Suon had shattered the continent in his anger about the humans' misdeeds. From that day on, the old empire was in shambles and the worship of Fafnar is now forbidden in the new empire.\nBut the cult of Fafnar still exists on Kilmaresh, albeit in secret. Her followers go to great lengths to strengthen Fafnar's influence and try to re-establish her worship. To achieve their goals they are not above using either infiltration or violence. The Burning Gladiators are a special part of the the Wild Sun's cult. They are fierce warriors who seek to enforce Fafnar's will with a vengeance. If necessary they also protect the Priestesses of the Wild Sun on their rather subtle missions.",

Its body is made entirely of thick clouds of candy floss, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. A colourful mixture of sprinkles runs through its sugary limbs. This elemental is rather slow-moving, owing to its soft and fluffy body. Its movement leaves behind sugary, sticky residue that may slow and hinder opponents. It can also suffocate and gum up enemies with its sweet and sugary clouds. Candy floss elementals are rather slow-witted and unambitious, preferring to lay around and take it easy as opposed to actively attacking or seeking trouble. However, if someone invades their territory, they can still react aggressively. Unfortunately this happens quite often, as their clouds of candy floss are delicious to consume and lure unsuspecting foes. \n\nCandy floss elementals come into being through a process known as the \"candy floss catalysis\". This phenomenon occurs when intense concentrations of sugar and sugary substances are left to accumulate and crystallize into sticky, sugary masses, eventually forming into candy floss elementals. The precise causes of this phenomenon are still unknown, but it is believed to occur in regions with high sugar content and intense levels of warmth and heat.",

        "description": "Zarganash's hostile environment gave birth to an own breed of phantoms that differs by the hazards that help to form them from the tormented souls they once were. The phantoms that gave in to arbitrariness of almost obscene proportions are known as capricious phantoms. Their very existence is a contradiction and their presence is a pain to reality itself. What might be seen as aimed attacks are just manifestations of their unnatural state. Especially the human mind that tries to make sense of the mockery their presence causes, tend to actually see behaviour patterns and actions of the capricious phantom that are not really happening, just to make some sense of the hurtful confrontation. In reality the capricious phantoms are not existent at all. The concept that is hard to grasp for the mortal mind is, that they are kind of a blind spot in reality. An occurrence probably only possible in the twisted realm of Zarganash. These non-entities and their perceived actions are just a trick the mind plays, to cope with that what can't be understood or observed. Of course the results of their presumed actions are very real, even if caused by something entirely different than observed. In the end it makes little difference for a victim of the capricious phantom. Whatever it is or not has to be dealt with or it will cause damage and destruction. Luckily the occurrence is susceptible to normal weaponry and responsive to spells. So for many travellers the nature of the phantom is a moot point, they handle it like any other hazard, since at long as it can be 'killed', it's good enough for most. ",

The absence of such modifications in other observed minions of Those Below raises a slew of questions that are yet left unanswered.

In contrast to other minions in said armies they seem to lack the prevalent aggressiveness, usually displayed by them. The cave chimera seems bar of any emotion at all and only displays the most basic self-preservation instinct. They don't flinch or falter regardless how inevitable death might be. They lack any eagerness for battle but make up for it with their diligence. A lonely cave chimera will still attack outsiders, probably due to some basic conditioning.\nAs many other creatures that make up the 'arsenal' of Those Below they are rather mindless and have to be controlled by others. Unlike other minions though, it seems they can be given quite specific and mildly complicated orders in advance, that they will unquestionably follow. Such 'pre-ordered' individuals lack any flexibility and are unable to react to unforeseen changes. So the might mindlessly walk against some gate that has already been shut and at least in one occasion a squadron of cave chimeras stoically walked into their death from an already collapsed bridge.",

The devourer is an extraordinary example of such principles. It is living machine of teeth and muscle, ready to chew and devour everything in its path. The sheer appetite of the devourer seems absurd to a level that borders magical abilities. Dwarfs claim, that devourers were observed that devoured piles of rocks, five times of more mass then themselves, without changing size of mass on their own. This lead to over the top tales of dwarfish explorers that assume that the individual devourers are just remote parts of a bigger organism that is magically connected to them and feeding on all that his remote maws devour. Wherever these stories came from, they have spread through the dwarfen troops and handled as common knowledge. There is yet no scientific evidence of such claims and attempts to capture a devourer only lead to the entrapped devourer turning it inside out, devouring itself, so to say and dying. Devourers diet seems to contain of everything. When left alone they devour minerals, though they don't tend to burrow tunnels while eating and rely instead on loose rocks. Given their appetite, it's remarkable, that they actually can concentrate on battle when needed and put their hunger aside for a while. When the battle is done though they scour the battlefield for corpses and everything that is too wounded to fight back. The dwarfs that fought them the most have another tale about them, claiming the devourers developed a special taste for rust and seem to see it as a delicacy.  \nThe devourers eternal hunger seems to rule all their actions so they know no fear or mercy in battle. They are constantly biting and gnawing, and almost enthusiastically employ this in battle to mangle their enemies. ",

The Chakoya Windcallers are considered as a mixture of saints and abominations, certainly nothing any sane chakoya would eat. Touched with the gift or curse of magic, a young Chakoya Windcaller usually grows up under the relative safety of a Chakoya Windcaller patron that serves as its  teacher. In some rare cases, a Chakoya Windcaller survives on its own, rather relying on its instinctive magic than on its brawn. As an adult, a Chakoya Windcaller has either been recognised and raised as such or gradually begins to lose its magic abilities, mostly turning into a Chakoya Toolshaper instead.\nThe magic of the Chakoya Windcallers is rather primitive. They use the elements for protection, enhancement or damaging effects. Like every chakoya, they rely on close combat so their ability to cast distance spells is limited. Instead they use their magical skills to increase their own speed and to freeze their opponents.",

One of the most invasive species encountered is the chasm spawn. The rate with that the chasm spawn reproduces seem to hit at a highly lethal habitat in that the spawn usually breeds. Due to the low likelihood of survival the chasm spawn produces numerous offspring. Now in the upper areas of the world this reproduction creates an overpopulation of spawns in the areas that they inhabit. As their name suggests they lay their slimy eggs into cracks, caves and chasms. Their anatomy allows them to crawl an walls and ceilings and reach even the most remote of cracks. In a relatively short time their finger sized offspring hatches and begins to devour its siblings. Still great numbers of then survive and inhabit their birth caves where they prey on lesser vermin. While growing up they seem to be fair game for other races that inhabit the tunnels and even other minions that serve those bellow. Even with this constant culling, their numbers are growing at an alarming rate. Even the chasm spawns seem uncomfortable with this, since reportedly there is an unheard amount of infighting amongst them and even acts of cannibalism. Still they are one of the more intelligent minion races of those below, showing acts of cunning and deviousness that hints at a planning mind. They use especially their wall crawling ability to set up traps and are capable of coordinated attacks and retreats. Even more disturbing is the rumour that minions of other races also show a more coordinated acting when they are around, but this observations were made in high pitched battles when perception can be deceiving and all those claims might be without any substance. This is similar to the claims that the chasm spawn is only younger phase of a larger, fiercer creature and that one of the leading generals of those below, the creature known as Abyssador is the final form of this process of evolvement.",

When the summer sun shines particularly strongly on the tops of the chocolate mountains, they melt and the liquid chocolate drips down into the marzipan grass. There, chocolate blobs form, which from then on streak across the surface of Candia. However, they are harmless and, unlike other blobs, they do not attack unsuspecting hikers. Sometimes they retreat underground, into the vast chocolate mines, where they merge back into the mountains.

Usually only encountered in the hottest places of the world, they were rarely seen in the past. Recently, though, there have been more and more sightings in the depths of Tibia. When they are encountered, they are usually in liaison with 'those below'. It can only be speculated what this means for the Cliff Strider race as a whole. While they were formerly seen as some strange life-form that was only dangerous when it was disturbed in its unbearably hot and hostile living spaces, it is now speculated that the Cliff Striders are some form of cattle for 'those below' that are also commonly used in their wars as some kind of weapon. Still, there are relatively peaceful and territorial enclaves of Cliff Striders that seem to pose no threat to outward communities. In the light of the connection to 'those below' there are furious debates how to handle such known enclaves. While there are voices to eradicate them all before the enemy can employ them, the majority is still voting to monitor the situation and get more solid information before any preemptive action is taken.",

        "description": "The cloaks of terror are the remnants of demons that entered the realm of Zarganash just to be devoured and ripped to pieces by its inhabitants. Their demonic residue slowly remained trapped in the realm and over time mixed and fused with other soul fragments, ultimately forming a new, vile construct that once again roamed Zarganash as mindless force of hunger and destruction. The cloaks are predatory and mostly instinct driven beings that prey exclusively on the living. When no living being is present they roam wide areas in their mostly futile hunt for prey. Eventually they slow down considerably and fall into dormancy after some time. While dormant they meld into the environment and are almost undetectable. Their overall composition makes them an undesirable prey for other denizens of Zarganash and so they can spent their time in dormancy relatively save. How long it takes to let them slip into such a state is widely different and probably dependent on several factors. Yet it seems common that they gather at some spots before going into dormancy. If a living being, in theory a rare occurrence in Zarganash, enters their presence, they wake up almost simultaneously which is a truly terrifying sight. A mass of silent levitating bodies that floats towards their target is enough to shake even the bravest warrior. Even worse though they emit a sound, that only dogs and certain other animals are seemingly able to hear, but that is nonetheless unsettling and even frightening to most humanoid beings. Their life detection has a fair amount of range and is seemingly shared with other cloaks in an area. Whenever one of them is able to sense life, all others will know and act on it. Their waking up is almost immediately and they waste no time before heading towards their prey. They show a great amount of violence and cruelty in their attacks, yet they seem in no way or form to devour any matter or energy of their targets. So it is even more astonishing what draws them to the living specifically and why they attack them with such ferocity. Why a creature in the land of the dead should so heavily specialise on the living is yet another insidious trick that the realm seems to play on intruders. No cloak of terror has yet been unleashed upon the realm of the living. It can be hoped that it's very nature is so heavily bound to Zarganash, that the cloaks are unable to pass the shroud between realms.",

Their tall hunch is covered with small horns and a downright oversized horn is jutting out of their foreheads. Both adult males and females feature this horn, though not the newborn young. Besides fighting with it, a clomp uses its horn to scrape away mud in wallows, to pull down plants for eating, and to open paths through thick vegetation. Clomps form a variety of social groupings. Adult males are generally solitary, except for mating and fighting. Adult females are largely solitary when they are without calves. Mothers will stay close to their calves for up to four years after birth. Yet sometimes clomps congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Salt licks are very important because of the essential nutrients the clomp receives from the salt - provided it's not the toxic salt of the dried seas and rivers which cover the entire peninsula of Krailos. The clomp is herbivorous, eating diverse plant species, especially their shoots, twigs, young foliage and fallen fruit. Clomps are the largest animals in Krailos, but although they are very strong and have a reputation for being tough, they are quite easily hunted by the ogres, as the clomps visit water holes daily and can be killed while they drink. The ogres mainly hunt them for their meat and thick fur, but the large horns and bones are also used for ogre implements. ",

They are able to crawl through even the smallest and most twisted tunnels, and reach places where other Corym can not go. As opportunity makes thieves, other races consider the Charlatans to be the worst of thieves, but by other Corym, they are held in regard as daring heroes. Their campfire stories are full of the exploits of the Charlatans, and detail how they outsmarted and outran their enemies. In combat, the Charlatans like to fight dirty. What they lack in strength they make up for in agility, and their attacks are often aimed at vulnerable spots and accompanied by feints, to catch their opponents off guard. The more Charlatans are involved in a fight to overpower an enemy, the bolder their attacks. Although they generally tend to be rather cowardly, most Charlatans are so convinced of the superiority of the numerous talismans and fetishes they wear that they will not back away even from a fight with more powerful opponents; and the Corym believe that through their talismans, a kind of supernatural power is bestowed upon them as well. They fervently pose as healers, diviners and magicians, utterly trusting their charms and ignoring all facts that might contradict their conviction.\nCharlatans are usually the first to be encountered if Corym move into an area, and if a single Corym is encountered, it is usually a Charlatan. On the other hand, as a saying goes, for one Charlatan you see there are always two more in hiding, and indeed Charlatans generally travel in packs. The death rate of the Charlatans is incredibly high and only the immense reproduction rate of the Corym still keeps them in existence. Oddly enough, most Corym that are born are found suitable by the Skirmishers to belong to the Charlatans. This is even more true in times of war. The Corym see this as a sign of their gods' favour.",

It is deemed a fact that a Skirmisher who has eaten a lot of books is more powerful than his brethren; but whether these two circumstances are truly linked to each other is still unknown. Skirmishers employ a lot of tricks that they claim are magic, together with simple forms of alchemy and medicine, and most notably poisons. It is verified that Skirmishers use a lot of alcohol to 'magically' make Corym warriors fearless and 'mighty'. It is the Skirmishers who create the numerous charms and fetishes that are highly prized by their kin; and given the superstition common throughout the Corym society, the superior status of the Skirmishers is absolutely undisputed. Admittedly only the most cunning of the Corym make up the ranks of the Skirmishers. As their attitude is to 'support their brethren from behind the lines' and to let others finish all dirty and dangerous work, while they have the authority over the best Corym resources, they attain great ages for the usually short-lived Corym and acquire a lot of experience and knowledge. This they only impart to their minion who are trained to become Skirmishers; and it gives them an edge over the other, often somewhat reclusive groups in Corym society and ensures their leadership. Another source of the Skirmisher's influence over other Corym is their secret knowledge of cheese production. Given to them by the gods, this sacred knowledge enables the Skirmishers to work the 'wonder of cheese' and supposedly gives them access to special cheese magic. The ritual of divining the future by the smell of the sacred cheese and the devouring of the cheese by the oracle is a spiritual experience for the Corym community... and a free first-class meal for the oracle.",

        "description": "The Vanguards are the gatherers, tinkerers and craftsmen of the Corym. Usually of a build somewhat more muscular and hardy than the regular Corym, they have many responsibilities in the Corym society. They are the guards that keep vigil over the den and all resources. They craft the crude but mean weaponry of the Corym, and repair stolen or found goods to render them suitable for Corym usage. Most importantly, certain Vanguards are responsible for keeping the slime tunnel system running. The slime tunnels are a well-kept secret of the Corym and work with specially prepared slime and swamp gases to provide long-range transport between remote Corym dens, in a way everyone else would consider rather disgusting as well as insanely dangerous. The gruesome accidents in the tunnel system are usually discarded as the failure of a charm the deceased, or crippled user had been wearing.\nThere is nothing a Vanguard cannot put to good use. They collect all kinds of stuff, broken or new, and stockpile it for later use. It is a great disgrace for a Vanguard not to have something somewhere, for to at least temporally fix something or rather, everything - aside from their ordinary tasks, most Vanguards consider themselves inventors. Whenever possible, they mix and match the pieces of their collection with each other, often with no clue as to what it is they are working on. Most of the time, the outcome is completely unreliable or unusable; a fact no Vanguard would ever admit. Inasmuch as possible, they convince others to wear, use or try out their inventions. Given the fact that there are only very few volunteers, this is usually handled by a complex system of 'I owe you'. When someone accepts a favour from a Vanguard, he should expect to become a test subject of some kind of invention at a future point.\nThe Vanguards are more robust, better trained and far better equipped than their kin. In times of war, they are therefore found in the front lines of battle; and even in combat, the Vanguards like to try out something new. As this is not merely limited to weapons, but includes all kinds of tactics and attacks, the Vanguard is quite an unpredictable opponent always full of nasty surprises.",

        "description": "Courage leeches are not actual entities but an actual manifestation of a void that the loss of courage by the souls in Zarganash leaves behind. All the more does the animalistic intelligence that they display mock such origins. Yet as it was the realm of Zagarnash that gave birth to them, this fact might only be an expression of some cosmic law that makes everything in Zarganash a twisted mockery of sane expectations. The courage leech are not actually leeching courage but they poison their victim's soul with a numbing enchantment that makes their targets prone to their fearsome attacks. They carry desperation and fear like a disease they spread, albeit involuntarily. While their own intention is probably more mundane, the stealing of essence and the spread of inner corruption is what makes the leeches extremely dangerous, especially for the living. Even more disturbing is the fact, that even when someone survives their attacks or overcomes them, the attacks of the leeches leave a spiritual scaring on the soul that never truly recovers. The interpretation of such scaring differs wildly. The most common interpretation is, that the soul is actually damaged if not diseased and that even to most pious, devout and pristine souls can be affected. This scaring is unaffected by any magical means known to men and seems not to heal on its own, even over an extended period of time. The death cultists of Ankrahmun see it as a permanent damage to one's soul, yet they claim to be able to repair the souls of true believers in elaborate rituals. In some rare cases souls harmed that way recovered seemingly on their own, but such occurrences are so rare that only anecdotal evidence exists and no reproducible steps could be determined. Some enchantments might provide a temporary shield that prevents the wounding in the first place but the few techniques to acquire such shields are closely guarded and seem to come with heavy penalties for the user. The leeches seem to have an affinity for the entity known as the unwelcome and are drawn to areas where it thrives. Given their nature it seems unlikely if they are allied, so it's up to speculation if they somehow leech on the action of the welcome or if is somehow using them for unknown purposes. ",

They have, however, a grasp on human language and can understand simple phrases. The creatures in itself are rather docile and passive, yet due to training their stoicism is usually overcome and they attack all presumed aggressors in a given area. \nThe training of crab men is a slow and arduous process. Some of them prove to be untrainable at all and are often released into the wilds where most of them just starve to death as they seem to have little own drive to sustain themselves. \nThe crape men have a love for the sea and despise the dwelling on land, yet their physiology is far better suited for the latter. This inherent tragedy of their existence lead to the death of several crape men by drowning, as most of them are not capable to stay under water for prolonged periods of time. \nTheir breed is one of the most unstable ones of Dr. Marrows creation and so the range of differences and mutations is huge.\nSo some of them defy the above mentioned aspects and for instance display greater intelligence and a few are even capable of beathing under water indefinitely. \nIt is assumed that over the cause of the next decades a natural selection will favour some mutations and help them spread amongst the creatures' population.  \nAs an oddity crape men show a high disdain of cucumber.

Still, this is disputed and it seems more likely that they are only extremely sensitive to the commands or needs of the hive. Be it as it may, the Crawler can be encountered in each part of the hive and on the battlefield. They fight less aggressive and more coordinated than their brethren, though, they lack somewhat the strength of the others. They are even known for their retreats in a battle, just to regroup and attack again. Crawlers are swift and seem never to get tired. Even in futile tasks, they will not give up. Their tireless persistence is one of their most notable traits. They seem to be able to exist for an incredible long time without any form of nourishment and are one of the few Hive Born that can operate a significant amount of time underwater. As allrounder, they often aid their brethren in battles and seem to be capable fighters on their own.\nSpeed and effectiveness are the hallmarks of the Crawlers. Their true status in the hive, however, is somewhat enigmatic. Their use for the war against the Deeplings is somewhat limited. Although some of them accompany the marching armies of the hive, most of them stay back as rear guards and to expand hive structures in gained territory. However, groups of them also accompany greater armies to harass their opponents and particularly to single out weakened targets.",

They are neither impressive fighters nor do they have good equipment, but their madness gives their gaunt bodies frightening physical power and resilience.

Regardless of their own safety and with the fury of a madman, they might not pose a real threat to an experienced fighter, but their attacks can be fatal for an ordinary citizen.\nIn their few sane moments, they travel much, so they can be encountered almost everywhere. Some cultures, which are usually hostile towards humans, praise Crazed Beggars as blessed beings. In rare cases, it has also been reported that one of them started to see his madness as divine providence and start to form small cults of equally mad cultists. Created by a mad mind, such cults can be devoted to almost anything, from mundane objects to completely deranged philosophies that only a madman can understand.\nEven without a leader or a common goal, Crazed Beggars often team up led by an instinctive need for protection and company.

The first encounter of them probably took place not in their own realm but on Tibia. Just recently some older reports about an attack on a caravan could be connected to them. In the reports of the few survivors the caravan in question was attacked by a roaming orcish tribe. When all seemed lost, the orcs where attacked by what they would later call elf-like 'bow-furies'. At first the traders and their mercenaries were happy about their unsuspected rescue until they recognized their 'saviors' made no difference between men or orc, shooting and hacking their bloody path through them. At least the ferocious attack gave some of them the opportunity to escape with their bare lives at least. When the survivors later returned to the battle-site with reinforcements they found everyone slaughtered, not even the horses and pack-animals were spared but nothing of the goods were plundered at all.

The unturned dream-born seem reluctant to engage them in combat, probably in the hope they still can be saved. Given their probably infectuous nature, any pity seems ill advised though. Even if they are not mad beyond any help, it's far too dangerous to allow them to spread whatever cursed them to other creatures.

Neither did it match any description of mythical creatures. All the more it is astonishing that considering their formerly unknown status sightings of Crustaceae Giganticae have become more and more common nowadays. These dwellers of the deep seem to leave their ancient habitats for unknown reasons and seek new areas to live in. Given the warlike nature of the Crustacea Gigantica it is somewhat unsettling to think what might have driven them away from their old realms. As of today, there are no valid theories about this occurrence, and although the quara are often mentioned as a possible cause, it seems more likely that the real cause is a new threat that lurks in the depths of the ocean.\nThe Crustacea Gigantica itself is not necessarily destructive but very territorial. When something enters their habitat, the simple-minded beasts distinguish only between food and robber. Both are to be eliminated by their powerful pincers. Their armoured shell serves for more than adequate defence in such cases.",

Most members of their trade die soon by traps, ancient guardians of the tombs or blades of adventurers. Only those cunning and tough enough to survive those perils become the dreaded and despised crypt defilers. They have gathered a meagre fortune to be able to afford better armor and weaponry and some of them even learned to turn the parts of buried creatures into toxins. They are responsible for leading bands of grave robbers out of their customary regions and finance expeditions to seek fortune in far lands. It is due to their dubious courtesy that parties of grave robbers can be encountered almost everywhere in the known world. They and their henchmen are often drawn to a newly discovered crypt like flies to a cadaver. Though some of the crypt defilers are in the employment of eccentric collectors or dealers of stolen goods, most of them are just unscrupulous thieves. Some of them have learned that strength comes in numbers and band together for a common goal, often employing a bunch of less experienced grave robbers. Such alliances usually don't last for long though, as these individuals are prone to betray or sacrifice each other in the face of even the slightest danger. Still it is not unheard of that some of these gangs last long enough to acquire a name for themselves, others have some form of 'representative' in the more dubious parts of the larger cities that can help in the acquiring of 'long lost objects' - for a price of course.",

However, the Crystal Spider was affected much more heavily than the frost dragon. Its body drastically changed to a crystalline or rather icy consistence, emitting an enormous cold. Its spiderwebs are not made of silk but of concentrated ice which is extremely cold. The cold alone is sufficient to freeze most creatures to the web which therefore does not need a gluey coating. The poison of the spider is like an injection of pure ice. It painfully freezes the flesh and numbs the extremities. The good resistance to cold that many creatures on the Ice Islands possess makes such advantage, however, redundant. For this reason, Crystal Spiders have specialised in hunting warm blooded creatures that are susceptible to their special abilities. This includes humans, elves and dwarfs. It is unknown if Crystal Spiders can survive in warmer climates. If they were able to adapt to warmer environment where much more prey is available that is susceptible to their attacks, they would easily spread through the lands like a plague.",

        "description": "The Crystalcrusher is more commonly known as 'Gembane' since it seems to be magically drawn towards cut gems, which are their favourite diet. It is not known by which means they can find cut gems or why they would specialise on a food resource that cannot to be found in nature. It is probable that this fondness is connected to crystal resonances and light reflection, though even the masters of these arts, the gnomes, cannot tell for sure how these factors influence the crystalcrushers' hunger or even their life cycles. On their constant search for new food, they often settle for other minerals in lack of greater amounts of cut gems. It seems that the crystals are used in the digestive system of the creature to pulverise other minerals. Given the Crystalcrusher's appetite, such digestive gems are used up quite fast which might explain its constant search for more gems and crystals. On their hunt they usually see everything either as food or competition for food and become quite dangerous.",

At the beginning, the transformation only takes place at full moon, and the victim regains its human appearance the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation lasts longer and the full moon is no longer a necessary condition for the transformation. At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.\nWerepanthers are quick and agile, but not as tough and strong as the weretigers. They are cunning predators and their appearance is a mix between a panther and a human being. Like panthers, Werepanthers favour warm jungles as their homesteads and are smart and adaptable. It is believed that werepanthers whose fur has a bluish hue are even more cunning than their black-furred counterparts.\n\nThe curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.",

Sometimes wannabe magicians try their luck on spells way out of their league with typically dramatic consequences. Most such misfortunes lead to the untimely death of the vain caster in spectacular fashion, sometimes, however, it happens that some lesser demon is partly summoned and melts into the book containing the spell by absorbing the life force of the unfortunate reader. Such demon-book conglomerates can become enormously powerful by harnessing the knowledge contained in the book, demonic forces and whatever might be left of the casters memories and fractured soul. For their raw power and potential but also for their contained knowledge, such cursed books are hunted down by Zathroths librarians and bookkeepers and dragged away to some sinister place of forbidden knowledge. There they are trained, their skills honed and they become part of Zathroth's collection and serve as his guardian dogs to protect other secrets. Perhaps because of the way of their unwilling creation, cursed books feel nothing but spite, contempt and hatred against living beings. Sometimes they even plot to incite mortals to follow their own foolishness and use spells beyond their power. Whether they do so to create more of their kind or just to enjoy the misery of others can't be told for sure. Most of them just skip such subtlety and attack anything not allied to them or their masters with all of the raw power available to them.",

Kept in line by the promise to gain forbidden knowledge and parts of their master's power, they are just as scrupulous as their masters.

This way, the Dark Apprentices usually focus their scheming minds on other apprentices instead on their master. Being constantly treated badly by their masters, they use every opportunity to demonstrate their own malice over other beings. Usually more ambitious than competent,  they are minor threats only.

Some time after coming of age they wander away to fall into a neverending slumber deep underground. Standing in pitch-black darkness, sleeping still, dreaming quaint dreams of death they await the time of joint uprising. Some are born to be chosen custodians of their siblings, awake and sentient.\n\nDue to a curse, they have undergone an incomplete metamorphosis and remain human. Their extreme determination and will to defend the Forest of Life, for example, stems from the fact that they deeply feel the need of all their siblings and will fight, if blindly, for their survival. Mumbling and full of aggressiveness. They can be described as deformed humans, connected to a complex hive mind.\n\nDark carnisylvans are tainted by corrupted magic and try to enchant their victims with bizarre spells. It is not easy to escape the clutches of a dark carnisylvan as most of its spells are also instantly affecting the mind.",

Fallen victim to the misuse of their magical powers for personal and selfish goals, those magicians have turned their backs on their fellow sorcerers and tread forbidden paths to acquire more and more power. Some magicians are pursuers of the dark arts of sorcery right from the beginning of their career, others became Dark Magicians by looking for revenge or sometimes only survival after being cast out by the magic orders. Still, knowing that they are magically gifted and thus feeling superior to humanity and ordinary mortals, the Dark Magicians carve their own niches in existence. They can be found in hidden caves as well as in ruins or remote hideouts. Although usually loners, they sometimes have minions to help them with their evil schemes or serve themselves under the rule of a more powerful being. In the service of some scrupulous leader or for their own good, they pursue sinister researches and projects. In their aspiration for power, they often meet their death by the hands of more skilled adventurers. Only a few of the Dark Magicians have what it takes to endure the long road to become a necromancer or a warlock after years of studying and gathering power.",

They enter the mortal world because they begrudge humans and other peoples their vigour, beauty and happiness. They seek to destroy positive feelings as love, contentment and mirth, because herefrom they gain their energy. An asura especially stalks men she regards as handsome and happy. These victims are lured into gorgeous palaces full of riches and conveniences, inhabited by several asuri. There they ensnare the men with amusements such as wine, music, dance and intoxicating substances that indulge their senses and make them submissive and weak-willed. Then the asuri divest them of vitality and beauty. When an asura gets weary of her victim or if captives unexpectedly oppose the demonesses, these unfortunates come to know the true face of the palace: As the asuri show a beautiful face outwardly and are in truth terrible demons, likewise the palace, behind its marvelous veneer, is full of prison cells, torture chambers and even rooms where sacrificial altars await the asuri's emaciated victims. \n\nThere are several kinds of asuri. The dawnfire asuri have tanned skin and black hair, favouring clothes in the colours red, orange and yellow. They are associated with fire and energy and prefer to use magic rather than weapons.",

While the green slime is constantly absorbing living things as a source of food, the Death Blob is less picky in this matter. It devours everything that comes into contact with it. Death Blobs are even able to dissolve harder materials using its gastric juices.\nDeath Blobs arise out of green slimes. In the course of centuries, a green slime tends to eat quite a lot of negative energy which usually comes in form of cursed objects, undead material, demonic remains and other sources. This negative energy slowly poisons the slime up to the point where  the ordinary green slime turns into a black undead slime, consisting of a huge amount of negative energy. The undead characteristics make the Death Blob quite a strong opponent. Although it has quite some power and extra abilities, it seems to be driven by its primitive instincts and only aims to destroy everything in its way.",

Gnomes tend to exterminate all fungus worm populations entirely, not only for the damage they could cause on fungus farms but for the fear they might be a younger state of evolvement of the deepworm. Though every research end evidence has disproven this theory, the typical gnomish mushroom farmer will take no risk. The true reproduction of the worm is as disgusting as it's other habits. Deepworms are both male and female. In their mating that is more an entangling and wrestling with each other, both compete to penetrate the other with some kind of stinger on their belly. The winner injects their eggs into the losers body. After a few days that worm becomes slow, fat and tired. After a few days he bursts and the deepworms that were eating it from inside out scurry in all directions. \nThe deepworm itself is a disgusting creature with even more disgusting eating habits. Though it's usual diet consists only carrion and plant matter, the worms are known to attack weak, ill or incapacitated being. Their silent attacks on sleepers has cemented their reputation as disgusting killers that have to be exterminated. In the armies of those bellow the deepworms show a far more aggressive behaviour. They attack every enemy and are surprisingly capable fighters. if left alone they roam the depths almost mindlessly at a slow pace. In employ of the deep armies though they are disturbingly quick and mindless aggression can become frightening at times. They know no fear and will throw themselves at each and everything in their way. Their lack of self-regard make then dangerous fighters that will deliberately take a blow just to land a bite on their victim. Wounds don't slow them down, they don't even show any reaction to it. Their thick, stinking blood that closes their wounds quite fast is mildly corrosive to other creatures. \nAfter a battles they roam the battlefield and look for corpses to eat. This and their habit to burrow into the corpses let some of them end up in the belly of a devourer who compete with them for the spoils of war. ",

        "description": "Demon outcasts are demons who have somehow fallen out of grace with their superiors. In demon society, this might happen for any reason and usually, punishment is swift and final. Sometimes though, annihilation may be considered too swift or too much of a waste. \nOutcasts are branded for eternity, and even if they manage to serve their way back into the ranks of the demons, they are still considered inferior and disgusting - if only because they remind other demons of how quickly anyone may fall. The treatment of outcasts varies with the whims of the local demonic rulers; some outcasts might serve as gladiators for entertainment, others are used as subjects for various tortures and experiments.  Only in rare cases do demons bother to keep outcasts as prisoners; usually if they are supposed to be in possession of valuable information or particularly useful powers. The life of an outcast is miserable at best, and either way a constant fight for survival. The continuous hardships permit only the most cunning and resilient of them to survive, and their natural aggressiveness is magnified to an extreme extent. Outcasts are prone to going berserk, and even if they should somehow have gained their freedom, not much in their behaviour changes.  Outcasts usually don't think in long terms. Surviving the next day and venting off their immense anger is everything that matters to them. Their only delight seems to be to destroy and inflict pain and suffering to others. Sometimes, that attitude has induced demonic leaders to use them as expendable shock troops or to unleash them in an area that should simply be devastated and made uninhabitable. Once loose, they usually feel nothing but contempt for other demons and are unlikely to follow orders from anyone but the strongest and most frightening demons. As there is no common ground for outcasts even with their own kind, they only \"join forces\" for some random destructive acts. If there is nothing else to destroy or kill, outcasts will soon attack each other, and therefore no organised outcast societies are known. Only recently, escapees of a demonic prison joined the ranks of the known outcasts. They once belonged to the entourage of powerful demon princes, and might actively act to free them or regain the attention of a demon prince. Whether this is only a temporary switch to older routines or a more pervasive cast of mind remains yet to be seen.",

This gets them often into fights with the smart but physically weak imps. Since both races feel superior over the other, they do not get along too well.\nUnder a strict leadership the Destroyers prove quite competent in the area they are employed, which is usually to destroy things and to mash people. However, their true strength comes through quantity. Demons of higher ranks like to accumulate a horde of such minions and let them loose on a target. Such an unleashed horde of Destroyers is virtually  unstoppable.

        "description": "The source of the devourers are slime creatures of unknown origin that over the course of generations have soaked that much glooth residue that they became something new. The driving force of these creatures is an insatiable hunger and their digestion relies on incredible strong fluids. In the past the tiny ancestors of the devourers were used in Rathleton in waste disposal and they were deliberately allowed to roam the sewer system. First incidents with the nearly mindless creatures brought the officials to rethink that strategy. But it was already too late to stop the spread of the devourers. Even worse several extermination campaigns lead to an increased survival of the fittest evolution of the devourers and in few generations the slime creatures had doubled in size and fierceness. As a cannibalistic species they begun to further their own evolution by eradicating the weak and sick which lead to further selection. Some scientists speculate that the devourers are still evolving with each generation and that they will eventually grow even further with no limits. There are rumours about devourers that fused together in fearsome fights and continued as even larger and more dangerous versions of themselves. Even more alarming is the fact that the devourers are seemingly no longer dependent on glooth residue as they have not only spread outside of Rathleton but newly hatched devourers have travelled as blind passengers on ships and in cargo to different places and created new colonies. Wherever devourers are encountered officials are eager to exterminate the threat to prevent them from gaining a hold in populated areas. Devourers are not picky in their diet. Their powerful digestion system enables them to dissolve almost everything and they seemingly know no fear or pain. For some reason they prefer living food over dead matter and attack most beings without hesitation. Since they have some kind of preference chain they will ignore anything else if they deem something as 'tasty'. As it seems, humans are considered as incredibly tasty by their primitive instincts. Devourers are considered as extremely dangerous and the words 'Run! The devourer comes.' have become a common phrase in plagued areas. Given his resilient nature and omnivorous appetite only caution has yet prevented further spread of the vile creatures but it's sadly just a matter of time when this threat to everything becomes commonplace.",

        "description": "Given the highly aggressive and predatory nature of the diremaw, it's a marvel how the hidden masters in the depths keep them under control. Even amongst themselves there is a constant aggression and re-establishing of the pecking order. When left alone the diremaws constantly challenge each other to fights, though weaker devourers submit to the threats of the stronger ones and fights are averted. This aggressiveness extends to other minion races of those below and they usually leave the diremaws on their own. In battle the direwmaws are forced to work alongside each other and allies. Even then they can't supress the occasional hissing and threatening of others that come to close or steal their kill. Still they relish in combat and seem to enjoy it. The stronger diremaws are often seen in the front of assaults where they excel in spreading fear and mayhem amongst the ranks of the enemy. Their focus on aggression levels often an opening for a counterattack but the diremaw seems nit to care. Especially they seem to feel no pain at all and even try to fight when cut into pieces. Their constant fighting has honed their reflexes and trained them into fighters that are matched only by a few. The dwarfs tend to face them heavily armoured to be better protected from the loss of fingers and other body parts. Given their seemingly constant state of agitation it's amazing to learn, that they never seem to tire at all. A diremaw can fight for hours if not days and show no sign of tiring. Often small herds of them are employed to constantly scout the are around a base. Then they circle that base tirelessly at their highest speed without ever taking a break. Their whole behaviour is somewhat comparable to rabid animals and some assume that the devourer might have been drugged into this state of frenzy. The rare sightings of roaming devourers that have no connection to the armies of below suggest though, that the high level of aggressiveness is just part of their nature. ",

The most desperate and self-loathing souls eventually emerge as distorted phantoms. Unstable and unhinged even for the standards of Zarganash, the distorted phantom is on a futile quest to end its own existence. By angry attacks it tries to provoke to be killed. The harder the resistance they are met with, the higher are its hopes of destruction and the more furious their attacks become. They drive themselves into a frenzy and ceaselessly continue to attack without any regard for their own protection. In the end, even if destroyed, the distorted phantom is soon reformed at another place of Zarganash, to embark on its endless mission of self-destruction once again. Ironically the inner conflicts are what keeps the distorted phantom in existence and from slipping into oblivion. Only by resolving such conflicts the phantom would have a chance to find inner peace and a final rest. This though is due to its nature and the laws of Zarganash almost and impossible feat. Without any help the phantoms will never be able to overcome the conflict and since they attack anything, seeking only self-destruction such help is beyond their reach. Some of the wiser and enlightened soul that try to heal and mend the scars of Zarganash target the distorted phantoms first in their mission of salvation. But even those would be saviours risk their existence and are attacked without mercy. If unprepared adequately most of them even risk to succumb to their own despair and rather join the ranks of the distorted phantoms. Due to their self-destructive nature the distorted phantom are drawn to all kinds of natural hazards of Zarganash. so a frequent sighting of distorted phantoms is usually a sign that an area is unsafe or a disaster is about to happen.",

These dragons bear a subtle, smouldering resentment toward their kin, their bitterness manifesting as sarcasm and cunning. Harbouring little sympathy for other dragons, they are unusually comfortable amongst other Dragolisks, forming cabals and circles to work towards common goals.  As longtime goals and personal ambitions seldom align, for most of the time a Dragolisk is often a loner, following its own agenda. Dragolisks excel in manipulation through their dark intellect and deceptive wiles, relishing in the slow torture, subversion, and ultimate destruction of individuals and communities. Instead of relying on brute force, they take pleasure in devious tactics like poisoning wells and abducting villagers to accomplish their sinister objectives.",

Only the most vicious of the numerous Dragon Hatchlings reach adulthood. In their tireless pursuit for food, they know no fear nor restraint. Adventurers visiting a dragons lair are often faced by a whole pack of Dragon Hatchlings, swarming over him like famished locusts. To make matters worse, Dragon Hatchlings are hardly encountered without their parents being close. Lured by the cry of their brood, the enraged parents tend to enter the battlefield in the worst moment. Furious about the threat posed to their offspring, the elder dragons become even more formidable opponents.

The body of such a Dragon Lord Hatchling is protected by red scales which already hint on its powerful destiny. The powers of a Dragon Lord Hatchling outclass those of any ordinary hatchling. So to speak born into the nobility of dragon kind, the Dragon Lord Hatchlings contain the worst traits any dragon hatchling could have. Although they are able to control their appetite in a better way than other hatchlings, they only use this self-restraint for cruel cat and mouse games they love to play with their soon-to-be food. And food can be almost everything that is or has been alive, even their own kind. Particularly, old and sick dragons, that did not leave early enough for the fabled dragon cemetery, often fall prey to their malicious offspring. As dragons are not willing to teach anything to their hatchlings, the youngsters have to become keen observers to pick up a few tricks and some magic from the older generation.",

        "description": "The Dragonling is a remote cousin of the known dragons. Though sharing many traits with the dragons and sometimes seemingly getting along with each other, the Dragonling has many biological distinctions which imply that any relations to dragons are remote indeed. Above all, they share a number of traits and organs with mammals, which has led many researchers to believe that the Dragonling might rather be an artificial chimera or construct instead. Extinct creator races as well as the ancient Yalahari are named as possible origins of the Dragonlings. Whatever the real origins of the Dragonling, it is evident that today it reproduces on its own and has preferred habitats. After mating, a Dragonling lays a dozen eggs in a hidden nest at some warm or preferably hot place. It leaves the nest alone for about a year, only to return when the eggs are ready to hatch. Often it finds its nest destroyed or the eggs gone due to the actions of other creatures. If there are eggs left, they will hatch as soon as the mother is there, seemingly recognising her proximity. The young will then follow their mother who will feed and protect them for several years until they are roughly the same size as their mother. Only a fifth of the Dragonling population is male. The males will leave the clan and only seek out other Dragonlings in mating season. The females and young form wandering clans, sometimes blending with others. Membership of a clan seems more a matter of choice rather than of birth. Unlike true dragons the Dragonlings will not hoard gold, even though they are obviously fascinated by its glittering. For that reason valuable items and coins end up being devoured by the Dragonling. The Dragonlings display snakelike abilities when swallowing objects greater than their mouth would usually allow. It is known that a slain Dragonling which was sliced open was found with a complete, mostly undamaged candelabrum in its belly.",

They have been disfigured in body and soul and became a disgrace for their own kind. And yet by decree of the emperor, they are still part of the society. That did not save them from the scorn of they brethren, though. Being physically even more powerful than the ordinary Draken but easily influenced by magic, they became slaves and servants of the spellweavers. The remains of their sentience is nearly burnt out by the cruel use of spell power with which they are programmed as loyal and obedient golems without any own ambitions. What is left of their sentience rarely recovers from this process, and so they roam the palaces of the dragon kings and their servants as nearly mindless drones. Their conditioning usually involves to attack anything that does not belong to the place they are bound to. If this command is triggered, the usually slow and passive Draken Abominations display a frightening amount of rage. It is unknown if this berserking is the result of the cruel conditioning process or an inherent state of mind caused by corruption. Either way, the rage amplifies their impressive strength and turns them into raging behemoths of destruction.\nOnly a few Draken Abominations manage to flee into the wilderness, usually due to mistakes in their breaking ceremony which lead to violent escapes. Those individuals are driven by their instincts and hunt in an area until they are brought down by the forces of the local overseer.\nDraken Abominations that actually possess sentience comparable to that of other lizards are most likely only a product of myths. In those stories they usually serve as physically powerful helpers of those in peril, or are even involved into a tragic love story with an ordinary lizard. Given the persistence of such stories over many decades, it might be possible that there is a grain of truth in them.",

All Draken use the best of their abilities to serve the dragon emperor, willing to die for the slightest failure. Yet, only the best of the best make it into the elite of the Draken society. The harsh and rigorous training hones their skills and makes them a living weapon at the disposal of the emperor. Wielding arcane power and weapons alike, the Draken Elite combines this with an impressive physique, turning it into a one man army. Using combat skills and spells, the Draken Elite has just the right answer to any combat situation in its claws.\nThe Draken Elite have become some sort of knightly or religious order in the lizard society. Their grandmaster receives his order only from the dragon emperor himself, and their chapter house is part of the dragon emperor's palace. If the need arises, the emperor lends some of the elite warriors to one of the dragon kings. Sometimes out of need, another time as a boon or token of respect. The elite forces handle even the most trivial duty they are assigned to with precision and unwavering diligence. Often it is sufficient to send a single elite warrior to fulfil a task. When the need arises, small squads are sent which are capable to handle most threats on their own. Given the rarity of the elite forces, such squads are only seen under dire circumstances. Actually it seems that the elite forces are that accustomed to work alone that they do not even get along well with other members of the elite, let alone with 'lesser' warriors at the empire's disposal.",

Combining their intellect with their inherent magical talent, probably comparable with that of a dragon, they make great spell casters of formidable power. Sadly, at least for the Draken this often means a rather dull life full of bureaucracy. They are high-ranking members of the hierarchy and with that they are often deeply involved in palace politics and intrigues. It is said their valued intellect binds them to such positions and all these intrigues and deceit are only ways to blow off steam. So when the rare occasion arises that a Draken Spellweaver takes part in a battle, they are often more fierce than their warrior cousins. They combine spells and physical attacks and so pose a threat to even the most experienced fighters. Although highly capable in the realms of magic, they only use a limited array of spells. Most of them are quite direct and have an immense damage output. The majority of Draken Spellweavers see battles as an welcome escape from their duties such as studying and regulating. They enjoy to leave all finesse and intrigues behind and to taste the blood of an enemy.",

        "description": "The mighty Draken Warmasters originate from ordinary lizard hatcheries. Still, in many regards Draken have many more similarities to dragons than to their lizard parents. It can only be speculated what has caused their change, but the first Draken were born in the first years of the reign of the dragon kings.\nIn the armies of the lizard people, the strong and cunning Draken Warmasters often serve as leaders or elite units. Due to their immense power, they have little to fear and happily unleash their rage in battle. As revered members of the lizard society, they receive the best equipment the master craftsmen can supply, and they use it with skill and precision obtained in years of sedulous training. This combination of skill, natural prowess and superior equipment makes them the most valued and feared troops in the dragon empire. The raising and training of the Draken takes much time and dedication. There are rumours that Draken neither die nor get weaker when getting older, rather the opposite, they are supposed to become more and more powerful with every day. The most ancient of the Draken are said to form the 'Flame Guard', the personal elite bodyguard of the dragon emperor, as well as the fabled 'Enders', the private executioners and assassins of the dragon kings.",

        "description": "The Draptor is a dangerous predator that is another result of the Zaoan breeding techniques. In the past it was common that proud leaders rode on powerful bred Draptors into battle or on parades. With the rise of the dragon kings it was seen as unfitting that a lizard would ride on a creature that somewhat resembled a majestic dragon.\nNowadays, the Draptor is mostly a beast of war. Sometimes the trained Draptors are used to boost the ranks of the lizard armies. Since a Draptor is prone to fits of berserk rage, this is not a strategy which should be applied lightly. When the Draptor can be kept in line though, it is a powerful addition to the troops. With shredding claws and dreadful jaws, they tear and bite through the ranks of their enemies.\nSince the Draptors lay eggs but do not breed them, they seek out hidden spots to place their clutches. Again and again such hidden eggs are found by travelling adventurers who take them with them as food or out of curiosity without knowing what they have found there. That way the eggs of the Draptors sometimes travel to foreign lands. It is only a question of time until this aggressive predator will conquer new areas where it will assert its instinctive behaviour and cause great damage.",

        "description": "The Dread Intruders were the first creatures that were encountered when the first destruction vortexes showed up. For a short while, they also comprised the largest group of the new enemies. However, this didn't last long and today only the most knowledgeable explorers still know about this fact.   \nIn many regards the Dread Intruders are considered as pure embodiments of the new threat. They were the first creatures who have been captured by aspiring scientists. By examining this enemy, they learnt about the Dread Intruder's fleeting nature as well as the fact that this creature cannot exist very long without the support of a nearby destruction vortex. Dangerous and highly volatile, the Dread Intruder was even assumed to slightly bend reality itself. In-depth studies, however, revealed that this is rather an optical effect caused by the sheer load of destructive energy accumulated in these creatures. Still, it can't be denied that the laws of nature seem to be weakened by its very presence. Even if a certain degree of probability is applied, one cannot deny the countless reports about flickering lights, distorted sound, or objects that suddenly show minor damages or even changed properties whenever a Dread Intruder was around. For this reason, particularly priests claim that the existence of the Dread Intruder defiles reality the most.\nDespite these numerous assumptions and speculations, the Dread Intruder is a dangerous force to be reckoned with. Although its lack of conscience seems to be a weakness, the sheer power of the Dread Intruder makes up for that, and one is well-advised not to encounter this powerful opponent unprepared or in disadvantageous situations. Even without any sign of intelligence, the Dread Intruder shows a horrifying effectiveness in exploiting a foe's weakness. This ability can only be explained by the theory that claims that the Dread Intruder is an embodiment of greater destructive forces.",

        "description": "Drillworms are aggressive beasts from the depths of the earth. It is assumed that they are a distant relative of the common rotworm, but no medical examination could prove this. In fact, studies have revealed that the Drillworm is, in fact, quite different from the rotworm regarding its movement, behaviour as well as its organs. It possesses two powerful legs which, in some circumstances, may also serve as arms. The Drillworm's set of teeth is only a secondary tool compared to the highly corrosive acid in its mouth, which serves as both saliva and digestion fluid. While the teeth usually are used to crush or get hold of something, the acid is used for quickly dissolving earth and stone, transforming it to a mud-like mass that can be gobbled up by the Drillworm, thus allowing it to pass through. The body of a Drillworm is quite resilient, despite its colourless, almost translucent skin through which its massive muscles can be seen. Although blind by normal standards, its eye-like organs are highly effective heat sensors, and its antennae, which are usually feeling the stone surfaces, can sense even the most slightest of vibrations. These organs grant the creature extremely sharp senses, giving it an edge in any subterranean environment. What is more, the Drillworm can retract the spikes on its tail and extend them so forcefully as to make a most effective anchor of it. Using this natural anchor, and forcefully twisting its body, the Drillworm sprays the stone in front of it with it corrosive saliva. Releasing the pent-up force of its twisted body in order to rotate forward at high speed, the beast puts itself into an actual drilling motion, enabling it to pass through the most massive barriers at frightening speed. Because of an obvious lack of predators and challenge in its natural habitat, the Drillworm is quite bold and, while not aggressive as such, still sees everything as food. Alarmingly, to the single-minded beast the movement and heat patterns of other living beings apparently indicate a favourite type of food, causing the Drillworm to attack. Only recently, Drillworms have emerged from the depths of the earth and are now to be found in layers that are already inhabited by the known underground-dwelling races. If the migration of the Drillworms continues, they might soon replace the known rotworm populations, as the rotworms pose no threat to the Drillworms and occupy quite a similar niche. Probable reasons for this migration are the rise of the heat and lava levels that can be witnessed all over the world, and which the gnomes refer to as 'global warming'. In light of these facts, not only an increase of Drillworm sightings is to be expected, but also the appearance of other subterranean creatures; and if the drillwom is to be any indicator of their threat level, this is dire news indeed.",

Although, it became important as beast of burden in the people's daily lives. In the earliest days of Ankrahmun, the nomads used Dromedaries to explore the desert. Later it became common to use them in caravans between the settlements. When Drefia was destroyed and Darashia and Ankrahmun ceased most contact due to their philosophical differences, the Dromedary breeding came to a sudden halt. Many Dromedaries were released to freedom, only to perish by the predators of the desert. Some of them survived though and revitalised the free roaming Dromedary population. For a while Dromedaries played almost no role in the settlements of Darashia, until recently, foreign adventurers rediscovered the Dromedary as mount. Dromedaries are somewhat hostile towards mankind though and are not easy captured and tamed. The biting, kicking and spitting involved in the taming makes the process somewhat tedious. Of course, it also does not help that the Dromedary itself does not behave any better than that as well. In the end, you end up with a very stoical mount, although it is rarely frightened at all. This, however, makes it somewhat difficult to induce the Dromedary to a higher speed.",

Dwarf Miners, however, are particularly protective about their secrets. This attitude often borders on obsession and in certain cases even crosses this border. To make matters worse, most Dwarf Miners are very attached to their mines, their tools, their ore, and their stones. Taking this into account, it becomes obvious that it needs only little to provoke the wrath of a Dwarf Miner.\nEven though, most Dwarf Miners are happy to dig through earth and stone in some mine beneath the Big Old One, some of them seek their luck elsewhere. Many of those \"emigrants\", however, were forced to leave their home and their beloved mines. Most of them displayed an aggressive behaviour that was unacceptable even for dwarven standards. For this reason, they were sent away by their fellow miners to search for ore in other mines. Now they are living in some kind of exile away from the dwarven society. Other dwarfs that can be found in places far away from the Big Old One are renegades. Not aggressiveness but greed made them leave the dwarven society. Some of them actually stole mining secrets to use them to gain a fortune in other areas away from Kazordoon and a society who considered them as criminals due to their evil deeds.\nNot driven by aggressiveness but by greed and their efforts to protect their wealth by all means, they tend to attack everyone they encounter in their mines. The result, however, is the same: a mad pick axe swinging dwarf that is trying to hack the intruder into pieces. Everything that Dwarf Miners might lack in skill, they make up with their exceptional constitution and an enormous strength, often accompanied by their anger and fury.",

Like all dworcs, the constant exposure to poison has made them immune to all toxic effects, and like all dworcs they like to apply some sort of poison on their weaponry. Without their allies their fighting abilities to delay and to distract their enemy becomes almost worthless, and so they pose only a little threat to a seasoned fighter.",

It is said that Earth Elementals form spontaneously, so to speak anywhere and not necessarily at a place where the earth has been defiled. The Earth Elementals seem mindless, guided only by some mystic field that spans the whole world according to the followers of Crunor. If an Earth Elemental is disconnected from this field, it becomes increasingly violent and destructive. It starts a rampage that eventually will lead to its own destruction. However, even the Earth Elementals that are connected to this field are by no means peaceful creatures. They follow a universal instinct that often leads to conflicts with living beings. The ultimate goal might be to bring some kind of universal balance; but to achieve this goal, much violence is used, relying on the enormous strength and resilience of the Earth Elementals.",

        "description": "The Damselfly is a giant version of the commonly known insect, so similar to the original that one must assume the animal has been magically enhanced in some way. On the other hand, it is certain that the Damselfly reproduces and has offspring of its own size. This leaves open the question whether its current state is the result of a deliberate manipulation, or whether some Damselflies accidentally came into contact with some kind of magic source, causing their giant growth. The latter theory sparked a search for this assumed source and an interest in Damselflies and their habits. So far, nothing conclusive has been announced by researchers. Meanwhile, the Damselfly has spread from the place of its first appearance in the Venorean swamps, and is frequently found in areas where its smaller cousin lives. Their diet consists of plant matter and smaller insects. Oddly enough, Damselflies are mildly aggressive when encountering larger species such as humans, which is atypical of their small variant. It is unknown what might cause this. However, the Damselfly poses a threat only to the wounded or completely unprepared wanderer. The creature can usually be found in areas with an abundance of insects they hunt and feed on. The Damselfly builds small cocoon-like structures made out of plant matter and saliva,  in which they lay their eggs, on the shores of bodies of standing water. The Damselfly young hatch as worm-like creatures that spend the first stage of their lives in the water, preying on fish, frogs, insects and other, smaller Damselfly larvae. After some time, the worm crawls out of the water onto a nearby tree where his husk solidifies, and after a few days, a mature Damselfly breaks free from the crumbling remains.",

        "description": "In a hostile environment like Gnomprona even the usually docile lifeforms adapted to a more aggressive demeanour towards their environment. Whereas the emerald tortoise relies on a diet of minerals, like stones and crystals, it developed an aggressive form of defence to ensure its survival. \nAside from the fact that the eggshells of the emerald tortoise are one of the hardest crystalline substances that even the Gnomes encountered yet, this tortoise processes the devoured minerals in a way that stows electricity in its body. Like some eels encountered in tropical waters they can discharge this energy seemingly at will, to scare away or even kill any predator. The emerald tortoise seems to have so much excess energy, that it tends to use this energy rather indiscriminately at even the slightest threat, which is often just the proximity of another creature or the sight of an unknown creature. As common in Gnomprona, the creature seems not satisfied with driving attackers away with such shocks but rather tries to actively kill its target, once acquired. \nThe massive emerald tortoise is still able to swim, though the relatively calm water around gnomprona might favour this in some way. In water their discharges are far wider reaching and more lethal. Therefore it would be ill advised to try ones luck in taking a dip into the gnompronean sea. Though that could make them the unchallenged rulers of subterranean seas, they rarely leave the land. At best they slowly drift towards some stone formation in the sea to harvest them for minerals and crystals. \nThe more docile giant sea turtles seem to be distant relatives of the emerald tortoises and are the only creatures known that don't trigger their defensive impulses. In fact there ae instances in which emerald tortoises were observed to seek refuge on top of their distant cousins and float around on them for a while. In turn it has been seen that they came to aid the giant sea turtles in the rare occasions some desperate cave shark tries to attack them. While there is little evidence yet, such rare occurrences seem to hint at the sea turtles being immune to the emerald tortoises energy shocks which would strongly hint at some form of relation of the creatures.",

        "description": "Energetic books were originally a race of shapechanging demons that planned to infiltrate Zathroth's hidden hoard of knowledge to steal enough of it to topple the demon princes and rule on their own. Cunning and knowledgeable they snuck their way through wards and wardens. With trickery and their shapeshifting powers they wormed their way into the heart of secrets. The knowledge they coveted so much was almost at their grasp. Though Zathroth might have seen the effort as admirable, their plot was revealed by his librarians and ultimately thwarted. Before they could finalise their coup, they were cornered, revealed and overpowered. Desperately they made a plea they were doing only Zathroth's work and therefore were not guilty but only zealous, for all they wished for was power through secret knowledge. It is said that the god himself spoke the final verdict on the fiends and forced them into the form of the books they tried to steal. He also bound them to the service of his librarians and to aid them through all eternity. The demons not only retained their original power but indeed were somewhat alleviated by the transformation. So in some way the dark god might have granted them a part of their wish. In the eons since then some aspiring spellwielders managed to summon and bind a few of the energetic books to their will. Most of them are said to be still bound to the holy places of Zathroth, serving as guardians, messengers and even power sources for certain twisted experiments. Little of their ambitious egos remained after all the centuries of servitude. All that's left of them is eagerness to see others suffer too. Their numbers might have declined over the centuries but still there are many of the once proud race around, disgraced, enslaved and with the hatred of centuries to be unleashed on any foolhardy creature they might be sent after.",

Seekers and preservers of knowledge to the core of their very essence is bound to the principles of Uman-Zathroth. The energuardians are extremely intelligent, with several independent brain spheres that by choice can work separately or in unison. They are constantly occupied with several projects at once and only a few spheres of them sleep at the same time. Even in face of mortal threat they are usually distracted by 'more urgent' matters. Still dangerous and powerful, it's hard to tell what potential an energuardian could unleash, if he'd ever focussed on a single issue like a fight. \nThough in general very reasonable, the energuardians are also devout followers of Zathroth and very strict in heeding their obligations. They are aware of their status, power and knowledge and behave extremely arrogant and dismissive towards other races and underlings.\nEach of them possesses a unique personal book that is no book at all but rather a scrying device which can display the contents of any other book it memorised and access books stored in the personal book of another energuardian within a certain radius. Each of those books is connected to the books of each other guardian and through willpower they can send written messages to the books of other energuardians. This form of communication has become so popular to their kind, that it completely replaced spoken language within their whole race. Only reluctantly they use their underdeveloped speech organs to communicate with lesser creatures.",

In the state of a spark, it swirls around for a while until it has gathered enough electrical charges and stirred up the wind to turn into a small storm. By 'riding' this storm, the elemental becomes more substantial and significantly dangerous.\nHurling mighty energy attacks and being almost insubstantial, Energy Elementals are extremely dangerous. They have some intelligence and actually enjoy blasting their enemies with powerful lightnings. Energy Elementals can be encountered almost everywhere, as they can spawn at any place that contains some air. Their main attacks are lightnings and forceful gusts of wind, but they can also cause some form of suffocation. Almost as fast as lightning, it is hardly impossible to escape from an Energy Elemental unless it is temporarily destroyed. It can regenerate itself by drawing air from the surrounding area.

        "description": "The minotaurs know several sects with several purposes. The mooh'tah masters and the death magicians being the most prominent outside the minotaur society. One of the most secretive sects is what the minotaurs call the high judges. They are the sheriffs, judges and executioners of the minotaurs, combined into a single person. They are almost seen as mythical figures and are structured like a military order and a secret society at once. No one knows who hides beneath their shrouds and masks. They are faceless as justice itself. The requirements to join their order is as unknown as their recruitment process. They rarely talk to outsiders other then to proclaim a sentence. Recently the order has stepped forward from the shadows though and their grandmaster proclaimed a death sentence to all enemies of minotaurhood. This places the high judges into the first lines of battle. In the first encounters not only their battle prowesses could be noticed but it also became alarmingly clear that they are not short in numbers yet no one knows for terrain about their manpower. Another mystery is that there are sects of high judges in almost all notable minotaur colonies and they all seem to follow the orders of a single grandmaster, regardless of the colonies allegiances. How the different sects communicate and coordinate even on different continents is yet another riddle though. It can be said for certain that two high judges will never fight each other in battle but the sect rarely fight in inner minotaur conflicts anyway. Usually they travel alone and pass their sentences on those they find guilty. People may come to them to mediate conflicts or seek justice and the high judges will answer their plea ... for a price. It's commonplace to present the high judges gifts for their expected services. Sometimes a high judge might feel offended by the gift and leave, sometimes he considers it an insult and instantly delivers his sentence for the grievance. So usually the gifts to the judges are quite generous and a high judge can expect free food and lodging wherever he travels. The judges are seemingly bound in their doings by something they call 'the code' which probably is some kind of text with laws. The tricky thing is, that this code as almost everything else concerning the judges is secret. The ordinary minotaur can only guess by the sentences what the code might consider forbidden and what not. This leaves them with only a vague feeling what is forbidden and what not. Considering the often harsh punishment that the judges delver most minotaurs tend to keep it save and stay away from everything that even remotely could be considered a crime. The moniker 'execowtioner' was given them by human adventurers who first encountered the sect. Calling a high judge execowtioner though, is asking him for a death sentence.   ",

        "description": "The eyeless devourers are no natural species in itself but seemingly something created out of cave devourers or even their streaked versions. Their eyestalks are purposely cut and they were probably put on a special diet or ores and organic material to enhance them further. This was quite obviously combined with some heavy conditioning. The whole purpose of those processes seems to be to create a strain of devourers that is more focused on battle than on feeding and more keen to devour organic enemies than to be distracted by their constant hunger for stones and ores. And indeed they seem more focused and battle-ready than their cousins. Their lack of eyes that supposedly enabled them to see sources of heat and magnetic fields was offset by a more keen sense of vibrations so they are not hindered much in combat at all. They tend to tag along with packs of other minions and attack in unison with them. It is rare to encounter eyeless devourers on their own without accompanying others as their entourage. Actually there are cases in which abandoned eyeless devourers had starved to death, waiting for someone to lead them along. Be mindful to approach such a lonely creature, however, as the presence of prey certainly will awake them from their inactivity and drive them into a hated frenzy.\nAnother strange phenomenon that has been observed is the fact that other devourers will go to great lengths to devour dead eyeless devourers that have fallen in battle. While they usually don't shun to eat corpses of their brethren, they do so only by chance when stumbling over them after a battle. But every other devourer and other eyeless devourers are obviously eager to prey upon their corpses. This lead dwarfish prospectors to assume that their bodies ae rich of some unknown mineral and there was put some effort of metallurgists into obtaining and dissecting and melting their corpses. Said efforts have yet to yield any results, though.",

At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.\nWerecrocodiles are strong and bulky, yet a bit clumsy and not very quick on land. They are dangerous predators nonetheless and their appearance is a mix between a crocodile and a human being. Like crocodiles, Werecrocodiles favour warm and humid areas such as jungles with larger bodies of water as homesteads. They behave very aggressively towards intruders. Feral Werecrocodiles have black scales and are rarer but stronger than their green-scaled counterparts.\n\nThe curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.",

The only thing that can be said with some certainty is that feversleeps are somehow related to the terrorsleeps, in whose company they are often seen.\n\nFeversleeps emit a strange, sweaty heat. When victims draw near, feversleeps often cloak themselves in shadow, becoming invisible, detectable only by their foul stench and a strange weakening effect they have on their prey, distorting their prey's sense of time and draining its powers so they can feed on it.\n\nFeversleeps love cool water, and are often seen next to pools or rivers, preferably underground in a dark and dank cavern.

But not all fell for this influence. A selected few rose against these blinded followers. When the elder god of the bog told the elves of Shadowthorn to capture all rioters, these insurgents started to sow what the lord of the bog hates most - fire. During the very short time this conflict lasted, both parties were about equal in both, strength and fanatism. In the end, the elf followers won the upper hand by an eyelash. The Firestartes were imprisoned in the dungeons beneath Shadowthorn. They are heavily guarded because the elves fear the Firestarters' wrath and the havoc they will surely wreak if ever released.",

They are often easy prey to the unnatural predators of the nether realms that feast on them in one way or the other. When not entirely destroyed by such vicious attacks those souls are changed forever. The 'leftovers' became more of an environmental hazard than anything else. Now completely barren of thought or purpose, they roam the planes before the afterlife with a hungry unawareness. Oblivious to anything but an unnameable greed they are drawn to live like moths to a candle. Their only purpose seems to be this need to devour, without even realising what it is that they want or need. Their hungry attacks aim to the life force of anything living and come close to damaging the very soul of the target. Perhaps with more sentience and purpose the attacks of the flimsy souls could drain and devour the souls of the living and actually change the state of their victims in horrible ways. Luckily such concurrences seem to be extremely rare but this is a development that is closely monitored by those who dabble into the knowledge of the netherworlds. The flimsy souls are frighteningly common and according to knowledgeable plane travellers and spiritualists their number has grown disproportionately in modern times. Despite their mindlessness they tend to occur in small groups and sometimes even form herds that jointly seem to search for an unknown target until they finally disperse after a while. Since they are hollow and bare of anything but the most rawest and stale proto matter of the nether realms other inhabitants largely ignore them. They are often found seemingly accompanying other denizens of the underworld, however, undoubtedly they are just following random impulses and stimuli forced upon them by their dreadful existence.",

        "description": "Floating savants are reanimated husks that are inhabited by the spirit of a deceased scholar. Technically they are created from the bodies of burnt out guardians of tales. Sometimes the guardians absorb too much or too dangerous knowledge so their minds become destroyed. Not to waste their nigh immortal bodies, they are salvaged to host the mind of a notable Zaothroth scholar of any race who reaches the end of his lifespan. Through secret arcane rituals the mind is extracted from the dying body and fused with the soulless shell of the guardian. The process is not without danger though and often the transfer shatters mind and soul of the scholar. For most followers of Zathroth taking that risk pales compared to the opportunity to pursuit their quest for knowledge for an eternity. The new physiology requires a long time of recuperating and adjusting for the savants. Especially the floating is a difficult art to master for most. While newly created floating savants retain their original personality, over the centuries their new body with little need for sleep, nutrition and worldly pleasures changes their behavior and outlook on the world significantly. Emotions and most ambitions aside for learning as much as they can, become more and more irrelevant. While at first zealously follow their research of their mortal days, for most of them the pursuit of their original fields of their studies soon becomes too little to fill their new won time and they begin to widely broaden their fields of research. For some those studies end abruptly with their own minds torn apart by forbidden knowledge and their bodies been reused again. Others live through the ages, more and more becoming removed from the world in their minds. Constantly creating, evaluating and comparing new theories and concepts they have little awareness of their surroundings and pay little attention to things short of imminent threats and hazardous environments. Most places that house floating savants use arcane alarm systems for that reason. Whenever a threat arises, this silent alarm is raised in the complex and waves of arcane energy are sent out, that disrupt the concentration of the savants, so that they turn their attention to their surroundings. Obviously the savants are not amused by this disruption by mundane threats and react with anger, eager to return to their studies as soon as possible. In combat they rely on spells and the inherit abilities of their bodies although they are not particularly trained in the usage of the latter.",

        "description": "The flying books are a creation of the squid race. They developed special sets of runes to write down their psionic knowledge while encrypting it at the same time. Over time they figured out how to arrange the psionic runes to create certain effects. The hovering of the flying books was the very first breakthrough in this area. In the centuries that followed, the squid race honed their skills and created a own caste of 'authors' to create weaponized books with psionic powers that emulate spells. Most of these tomes are hidden from the eyes of foreigners in their hidden enclaves. But the rather common flying books accompanied their squid masters to many of the laces they went to. The flying books are so mundane and replaceable for the squids, that they don't take great care of them and just leave them behind when they leave an area. Sometimes skillful magicians managed to re-purpose the flying books and subvert their control by binding them to their own. Though not particular more powerful then comparable bind golems the sheer rarity of flying books outside the squid community make them a prestige object for many aspiring magic users. Warnings that those books might have been just 'allowed' to be found and repossessed to allow the squids spying on others have yet to be proven and haven't stopped many from acquiring such a prestigious object. The idea that a device could constantly transmit information to its creator does nothing to diminish its popularity in comparison of the need of many to show off. That way flying books have been introduced to many places in the known world. Some failed attempts to overwrite the books initial conditioning have even lead to the creation of 'rogue' books that roam around on their own in their mindless pursuit of whatever random impulse might guide them in the moment.",

        "description": "The forest furies are the tragic product of careless experiments with the waters of Ashar'tel. Inspired by the rebellious amazons of Carlin, some young and restless elven maidens founded a sisterhood of their own. The futility of their protest against the rigid elven society and its rules soon drove them to foolhardy dangerous ways of protest that bordered on criminal acts and put them in danger of becoming outcasts. In a desperate attempt to hold her sisterhood together, their leader Emana Greenskull staged the theft of several amphora with the waters of Ashar'tel, branding the sisterhood as outcasts, thus binding her followers to her by denying them the option to peacefully return to society. With little knowledge about the water but convinced it contained power, Emana and her sisters drank from it. At first they truly felt the surge of power they expected. But the water became like a drug to them and slowly changed their very nature, mutating them into something else. Convinced that the voices they heard in their intoxication were revelations from nature itself, the sisters embraced their change and even enforced it. The change however left them mutated not only in body but also in mind, and after the last water was used up, and symptoms of withdrawal began to torture them, the remaining sisters were completely driven into madness. Renaming themselves to forest furies, they see themselves as the chosen of nature, enacting its revenge on the people misusing it - which is, in their twisted thinking, almost everyone but themselves and a few allies. The furies are unpredictable but hateful. They can not be reasoned with, and the best one can hope for is that they are so absorbed in some holy mission that they simply ignore anything else. The most ferocious and strongest of the forest furies bear the honorific 'Elder' and often charge themselves with guarding anything they see as sacred, attacking hapless trespassers. In battle the furies employ not only the physical force of their changed bodies, but also a variety of druidic spells, which are strangely enough often intuitive abilities rather than spells, and are unknown to other users of druidic magic.

        "description": "Freakish lost souls are some of the more self aware souls which, caught in their own cycle of damning thoughts, will still posses some form of animalistic instincts of self preservation. In a subconscious way they have learned to fight back the many attackers and predators that roam the nether realms. Still they often lack the power or finesse to fend off their attackers and are left scarred and changed forever. Somewhat battle-hardened they change over time and become an own subcategory of entity. On the surface they are like animals while in their core they are just another tormented soul, captured in this ghostly shell they subconsciously animate. In the contrary to flimsy lost souls, freakish souls like animals can actually learn things and react purposely, albeit with rather limited intelligence. In rare occasions a spiritualist was able to reach the trapped consciousness in a freakish lost soul and had a form of limited conversation, which rendered the instinctive side of the soul inactive for the remainder of the contact. As soon as the contact is broken, however, the animal takes over again and reacts extremely angry and hostile, using all of its capabilities to attack immediately. It seems that other, more conscious inhabitants of the nether worlds are able to train and exploit them for their own sinister purposes. As such they are often used as attack and watch dog-like creatures by their masters and can even be encountered in areas they would instinctively avoid on their own. Any attempts to awaken the dormant souls and to have them attain control over their state have met with little useful results. Especially those entities touched and trained by the more tainted seem beyond any help and redemption.",

Constantly in need to raise their status in the pecking order of their lairs, the Frost Dragon Hatchlings improve their skills and become probably more lethal opponents than the ordinary adult dragon might be. Only rarely they hunt in the wilderness; it is much more likely to encounter the hatchlings in their lairs, supporting their relatives in their fight against intruders who are foolish enough to set a foot in the frost dragons' territory.

The feeling to have to prove themselves all the time makes them reckless and aggressive and with that even more dangerous.\nFrost Dragons usually get along well with other dragons for a while. However, mixed communities often suffer from prejudices and lethal infights between the species. Though the mostly younger Frost Dragons often lack the refined magic abilities of their cousins, they are usually more powerful when it comes to physical abilities. Their newly gained control over the element ice easily makes up for their missing command of fire. They still possess a quite impressive resistance against fire from their dragonic heritage. Unlike other dragons, the Frost Dragons do not live alone or in small families. Instead they tend to form flocks of frightening sizes. Flocks of Frost Dragons usually inhabit spacious lairs and claim large territories as their hunting ground which they fiercely protect against other predators.",

They enter the mortal world because they begrudge humans and other peoples their vigour, beauty and happiness. They seek to destroy positive feelings as love, contentment and mirth, because herefrom they gain their energy. An asura especially stalks men she regards as handsome and happy. These victims are lured into gorgeous palaces full of riches and conveniences, inhabited by several asuri. There they ensnare the men with amusements such as wine, music, dance and intoxicating substances that indulge their senses and make them submissive and weak-willed. Then the asuri divest them of vitality and beauty. When an asura gets weary of her victim or if captives unexpectedly oppose the demonesses, these unfortunates come to know the true face of the palace: As the asuri show a beautiful face outwardly and are in truth terrible demons, likewise the palace, behind its marvelous veneer, is full of prison cells, torture chambers and even rooms where sacrificial altars await the asuri's emaciated victims. \n\nThere are several kinds of asuri. The frost flower asuri have pale skin and white hair, favouring clothes in the colours white and light blue. They are associated with ice and snow and prefer to use magic rather than weapons.",

        "description": "Frost Giants are an extremely ancient race that inhabits the most northern parts of the world. Far to the north where it is cold enough to freeze even air, this race has its original home. In ancient times, when the gods waged war on each other, the world climate was shifting often. At this time, some tribes of the Frost Giants wandered to the south, following the biting cold and expanding their territory. Entire kingdoms crumbled under their feet.\nThe Frost Giants became the ruler of the frozen waste and their icy kingdom grew every day. One day though, the seemingly eternal winter ended. Temperatures were rising again and most Frost Giants fled to the northern home of their ancestors. However, some of them became trapped on their retreat, cut off by the ocean that once used to be a frozen surface which could easily be crossed. Many of those unlucky Frost Giants perished either by the warm temperatures or by enemies who easily overwhelmed them in their weak condition. Some, however, were able to find refuge at places just cold enough to sustain their existence.\nStill those places are not well suited as they are much too warm for Frost Giants. Cut off from the northern Frost Giant civilisation and living in an inhospitable environment, the Frost Giants are known for their bad temper. Their sole joy seems to be to make other beings feel even more miserable than they do feel themselves. So they enjoy hunting, torturing or just smashing other creatures. Given this attitude, it's not surprising that the Frost Giants, though considerably intelligent, won't waste much time in parleying. If there is a chance to fight, they are using it. Frost Giants are extremely possessive and they fiercely defend their grounds against all intruders.",

Although of deceptive beauty, the Fury is a bloodthirsty monster that knows no remorse. A Fury will not listen to logical arguments or accept surrender. Fight is everything they think about and care for. Her hands can turn into fiery claws that can shred a shield to pieces with ease and their incredible strength belies their slender and fragile stature. A Fury's hatred is so strong that it provides them with an unearthly resilience which can only be stopped by death. Literally too hot-headed to lead any sizeable force into battle, the demons employ them on missions of carnage and chaos. Even when not in combat, they tend to destroy things just for the fun of it. After all a Fury is a creature of hatred and destruction. Some demons employing the services of Furies keep them chained until the very last moment. Needless to say that this treatment drives the Fury in an even greater frenzy. Other demons enjoy to lock up prisoners in a cell with a handful of Furies and to watch the spectacle.",

Some gangs might follow a noble cause or only consist of some youths that banded together for protection, but in the harsh reality of Tibia, most gangs are nothing than urban  bandits. Usually led by one or two powerful and charismatic individuals, they claim parts of the city as their territory. The borders of these territories are often disputed among gangs and are subject of violent and bloody fights. The inhabitants that live in such a territory mostly have arranged themselves with the situation, accepting it as given as the rule of the local king.\nGang Members are usually encountered in groups, especially in greater cities with warring gangs. They tend to talk a lot about respect and honour but this is rather to comfort themselves, trying to forget how low they have come and what harm they do to the people around them. When it comes to combat they are all cowards, one way or the other. While some of them might fight to the bitter end, most will flee from it when the going gets rough.",

It seems the Ghastly Dragon is not a sub-race of the dragons but some sort of intended transformation. Sages assume that Ghastly Dragons are the failed result of a self-initiated transformation of some ancient dragon. While probably the original aim is to reach some state of transcendence, the failed outcome is a creature trapped between the spirit world and the mortal realm. The failed transformation often dangerously maddens the dragon creature. Even those who against all odds manage to retain their sanity have to cope with the knowledge that they turned in some, even in their own eyes, abominable creature instead in the intended ascended being. This leads to the fact that also the few sane specimens are usually not less aggressive and destructive than their mad fellows.\nAlthough the legends of the lizard folk also tell about some extremely wise and benevolent Ghastly Dragons, most of them that have been encountered are dangerous and powerful. The transformation of their bodies has changed their abilities significantly. They can draw upon immense powers and use them to wreak havoc on anyone foolish enough to disturb them in their eternal agony.",

But the Anuma conferred the dominance over Kilmaresh to the humans, in an effort to let them take responsibility of their own. However, after the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar and the cataclysm that severed the continent, the Anuma took the reign over Kilmaresh back - for the humans' own benefit as they said.\n\nIt is told that the girtablilu were first created by the sun god Suon in order to serve him and his sister Fafnar. They stood guard outside the gates of Suon's and Fafnar's temple high in the sky above Tibia, in a time when the divine siblings had not yet fallen out with each other. The scorpion men opened the doors for Suon and  Fafnar as they traveled out each day, and closed the doors after them when they returned at night.

        "description": "Gladiators are professional warriors. Some of them are desperate or unscrupulous beings that  willingly joined the ranks of the Gladiators, however, most Gladiators were forced into service by masters who had some sort of power over them. Already the training of the Gladiators is cruel and lethal and causes many dead bodies.\nIn the past, the Gladiator profession seems to have been more noble than today and people came mainly to watch  the impressive fighting skills. Nowadays, however, Gladiator fights are brutal and bloody battles which mostly end deadly. Only a few arenas have specialised in harmless fights which end after the first blood was spilled. Several cities have banned arena fights as they are too dangerous.\nWhen the games in Yalahar had become more and more cruel in order to distract the masses from other problems, more and more Gladiators were replaced with criminals and mercenaries of various races. At some point, the Gladiators rebelled and tried to take over the city. Even though the revolt failed in the end, the arena quarter was lost to the revolting forces. The Gladiators could not maintain some sort of leadership, though, and their community quickly splintered into several subgroups. Today, the Yalaharian Gladiators are often descendants of these rebels. The title Gladiator became rather a name than a profession. Also the new generations of Gladiators are trained  like their forefathers. They take part in brutal arena fights in which opposing families want to prove their superiority over each other.\nMost Gladiators who are encountered in more uncivilised areas are quite likely to attack just to make a point. Gladiators are foes with deadly skills and much battle experience that often gives them an advantage in a fight. Gladiators hardly care if they attack weaker or stronger opponents. They consider both as good possibilities to train their skills.",

        "description": "The glooth anemone is a strange plant creature that is considered a parasite. The thing is, that this parasite is actually by far bigger than its hosts. The glooth anemone mimics the harmless plant, also known as glooth anemone. The latter is a major food source and habitat for the gloothworms which are essential for Rathleton's economy. The glooth anemone creature is able to deceive the gloothworms into accepting it as a host and then devours the glooth that they produce. Not only does it devour more glooth than the tiny worms can spare without perishing, the glooth anemone also somehow forces the gloothworms to produce excessive amounts of glooth, which often drains them to death even before they can die through glooth starvation. Due to this destructive nature, the glooth anemone had to cope with the extermination of its food source that it caused on its own. The glooth anemone copes with that problem by being mobile. Their mobility has brought up speculations that it's rather a creature, posing as plant than a creature that evolved from the harmless and docile glooth anemone to a predatory parasite. While in the past the glooth anemone was a minor nuisance, the glooth-production and domestication of gloothworms multiplied its food sources almost over night. This lead to an alarming increase of the glooth anemone population and they became a threat for Rathleton. Several extermination campaigns, mostly rather started to protect the glooth than the population, helped to keep the glooth anemone population somewhat at bay, but recently it was discovered that glooth anemones have adapted to other glooth sources like the spoiled glooth that often is flushed into the sewers but they are also capable of digesting glooth products over time. This means that the glooth anemone can be encountered almost everywhere which in addition to their mimicry makes dedicated hunts on them extremely difficult. When not posing as a harmless plant the glooth anemone is extremely protective of its food sources. It is known that glooth anemones are able to absorb organic material like flesh too but it's entirely unknown if that could sustain the creature in the absence of glooth.",

        "description": "The glooth blob is the result of careless experiments with glooth and lesser critters like rats, insects and birds. Whatever the original purpose of the experiments may have been, the outcome was a slimy mass of semi sentient glooth. To make matters worse the products of the experiments were deemed a failure and discarded. That way several test subjects escaped and multiplied by splitting themselves after they gained a certain amount of size. The experiments were stopped and the magistrate ordered the files about them to be securely hidden and classified highly confidential. It seems in the beginning there were several strains that could be considered glooth blobs but eventually only one discernible strain seems to have survived. The blobs are often drawn to glooth sources though they seemingly not actively absorb it. Only in times before they split they actively consume glooth and glooth residue in great masses so it is assumed glooth is necessary for their reproduction. It is speculated though, that the glooth could possibly be substituted by something else but the magistrate put an end to further investigations in that matter. Though the glooth blob is not actively aggressive it its highly territorial and instinctively attacks any intruders. What is an intruder and what not seems quite random though, as glooth blobs are known to sometimes coexist relatively peaceful with other creatures. \nGlooth blobs are often drawn to sources of carrion and organic waste and therefore the Rathleton magistrate ordered a strict policy towards waste disposal to minimize the intrusions of blobs into the city. Of course ignorance and recklessness undermine this efforts and so a number of blobs is attracted by especially the poorer quarters of the city. Occasionally for completely unknown reasons great numbers of glooth blobs are spawned. There is no known common factor in this occurrences and usually they vanish as sudden as they appear, some are reportedly dissolving into pools and rapidly dehydrate into dust. In this times the blobs are unusually aggressive and dangerous as they actively hunt for prey. Blobs that have consumed a certain mass of matter and swollen far beyond their usual size have been observed, slithering towards a common point. No one has yet made out this point and there is not even a valid theory for what reason the glooth blobs behave that way. The magistrate has forbidden all further investigation because to the danger associated with it. ",

        "description": "The glooth golems that many see as the epitome of Rathleton's science are indeed based on cryptic designs that were found in excavations under the city. The odd design patterns were secreted away and studied for years by the best of Rathleton's scientists. Not fully understanding the concepts they adapted the few ideas they were able to grasp and integrated them into Rathleton's machinery. Only with the discovery of glooth and glooth-based material and power the adaptation of the strange designs advanced dramatically. Still most designs still were rather crude and huge but some daring inventors dared to dream the impossible. Not truly knowing what principles they were applying they begun to rebuild some mechanisms on the excavated designs. This lead to the creation of the first machine men. These machines were first only mocked designs that had to be operated and powered remotely but again it was the glooth that proved to be the saviour. It provided not only a means to supply the automatons with power but also enabled the scientists to give them a fixed set of orders and behaviour patterns. Though not able to handle more complex situations the glooth powered golems provided significant help in hazardous areas and were suitable for heavy work. Problems arouse from the not fully understood principles that made the golem move at all though. Sometimes the golems would no longer follow their simple programs and begun to wander seeming aimlessly. All attempts of repair failed on those golems that had gone astray. Even more disturbingly, those golems begun after a while to display strange behaviour patterns as if they had some kind of will of their own or even rudimentary intelligence. Alarmed scientists dismantled the malfunctioning golems only to face increased malfunctioning in active golems. After a while the failed golems were left alone and the situation somewhat stabilized. The malfunctioning golems seemed to avoid humans anyway and even the risen aggressiveness of golems that were malfunctioning and autonomous for significant time was discarded as a necessary evil. Some inventors were inspired by the displayed aggressiveness of the free roaming golems and added defensive patterns to their order designs so that even common glooth golems are able to fend off intruders into certain territories.",

Rather a coward, the Gnarlhound forgets quite fast about its fear when it gets angry, and it takes only little to anger one of those beasts. Their aggressiveness often offsets their cowardice and suppresses the impulse to flee. Instead they transfer it into wild and vicious behaviour which often looks quite similar to canine madness.\nThe Gnarlhound was one of the mammals that the lizard people raised as livestock to meet the ever-growing need of food. This led almost to the extinction of the wild population of Gnarlhounds. After the collapse of the southern areas, the Gnarlhounds turned feral once again. Missing any major competition in the food chain, the Gnarlhound population grew as quickly as that of the orcs. Sharing the same habitat, both races clashed quite often. In the end, most Gnarlhounds accepted their place in the pecking order beneath the orcs. Ever since, they seem to have some agreement from which post sides benefit. The Gnarlhounds serve the orcs as hunting animals, beasts of burden, mounts, and occasionally food source. The orcs share some of their prey and give the Gnarlhounds shelter and protection. Still, it is an alliance out of necessity, and the still feral Gnarlhounds are known to attack their supposed masters sometimes - not that someone in the brutal orc society would bother about such an issue.\nMisjudging the seeming 'pet status' of the Gnarlhounds, some orcs took Gnarlhound puppies on their journeys and found out about their feral and aggressive nature not until later. Some Gnarlhounds were then set free or escaped, and it must be feared that Gnarlhound populations also develop at some remote places and lands.",

Though Goblin Assassins are hardly anything else than 'wannabe assassins',  they are indeed the most tricky and cunning of their kind. They use everything at their disposal for fighting including dirty trick. They enjoy stealthy attacks and the use of paralysing poison to eliminate their enemies. Amongst their kind, they are revered as heroes. They often hold high positions, gained by trickery to get rid of other contenders for leadership. Every goblin chieftain has a bunch of assassins as close advisors. Since the king knows that his advisors would gladly stab him in the back to succeed him as chief, he plays a difficult game of playing off the Goblin Assassins against each other and sending them on suicidal missions to get rid of them. So, being a Goblin Assassin is a mixed blessing. It is desirable as it ensures a position of power which all goblins long for. At the same time, it is a threat for a goblin's life.\nIn battles, Goblin Assassins try to be as effective as necessary to keep their position and as inconspicuous as possible to avoid the attention of both, their opponents and their fellow assassins. To some extend, this restricts the assassin's effectiveness, though when under pressure, he usually plays out all of his tricks to either flee or to kill his opponent.",

        "description": "Goblin Scavengers play an important role in the goblin society. They are highly skilled in recycling almost any garbage into useful things. In the camps, older Goblin Scavengers sort out the loot the raiders and warriors get into their hands. The younger Goblin Scavengers are sent out into the wilderness to loot and plunder everything they can get. Usually they form parties that sneak about the lands of their enemies and try to get as much loot as possible. It is said that the loot bag, still very popular among modern adventurers, was an invention of Goblin Scavengers.\nWhen surrounded by enemies, they try to keep a distance and to attack from afar. Since Goblin Scavengers are usually seasoned scouts, they also possess some knowledge about the wilderness and plants. This enables them to poison their weapons with a moderate effect.\nYou never know what kind of loot a Goblin Scavenger might dig up from his pockets. It can be everything from a rune to much more valuable items. Goblin Scavengers occur either alone on a mission as a scout, in small groups of two or three, or as a band consisting of up to two dozens.",

In the process, the savory aromas confuse its opponents' senses. Luckily, it sometimes loses sight of its goal despite its big goggle eyes.\n\nAs the saying goes, the goggle cake may have originated from a magically-enhanced cake experiment gone awry. There once was a powerful magical bakery where various cakes, pastries, and other sweets were produced. The truffle baker was experimenting with powerful arcane magic to create a cake that could bring joy and delight to anyone who ate it. However, the experiment unexpectedly produced a monster made entirely of cake. The beast then escaped and began rampaging through the region, hunting down and eating more sweets and desserts. When it reached a certain size, it split into two cakes, which in turn set off in search of food. There are now quite a few cake monsters on the move in Candia.",

Aggression seems to be the driving force of their behaviour pattern as they even tend to ram trees until they break and fall, to later feast on otherwise unreachable leafs. Though they mostly graze on more reachable plants, its the mentioned behaviour that sticks to the memory of an observer mostly and serves as an ample warning to approach this creature with care as it eventually will inevitably attack. It doesn't matter, what the Gore Horn is distracted with in the moment, they attack anything on sight, assuming it's just another predator of the subterranean lands. \nDespite their individual prowess, the Gore horns tend to form small groups or even herds, to rely on strength in numbers. \nSuch groups of Gore Horns stick together closely and rather die together than to leave one of their own back. They are even known to relentlessly attack a predator that already killed one of their herd, protecting it's corpse for quite some time. \nAnd they are even more protective towards their young ones though those often hide in thickets nearby. \nSometimes such a herd of gore horns gets into a stampede in which they stomp down everything in their path. \nWhile the increase of volcanic activity was still a new thing in Gnomprona such stampedes were often observed, sometimes ending by the herd mindlessly plunging itself in the surrounding ocean and drown. Since then the creatures have to have grown accustomed to it and a stampede is a rather rare occurrence again. \nOddly enough for such massive and relatively clumsy lizards they often build lairs deep in caves or even the underground. \nCertain findings suggest that they use volcanic heat to help them hatch their eggs and that might be the major reason, they dwell in caves, close to the volcanic heart of the area, though the attraction of cold blooded creatures to heat might be another reason.

Yet as such creatures, if they even exist, are rarely sighted, there is little chance to proof or disproof such claims so they tend to be pervasive. Even for other ape creatures it's impossible to pinpoint any form of lineage as there are too many of what scientists call 'missing links' to trace down any ascendency. As tempting as it might be to connect the ape civilisations of Tiquanda and Banuta especially to the primal Gorerilla, there is no actual proof to justify this. Despite heated debates, with little evidence, in the end it became a moot point in the end which species of the known bigger ape species are descendants of this vicious species. \nThe Gorerilla itself is a brutal predator that heavily relies on scare tactics to fend of other predators. Posing and yelling akin to that of ordinary gorillas and their relatives might stop only the most impressable predators in Gnomprona. \nBut their threatening behaviour can be backed up by the raw power, steel-like muscles and a set of nightmarish teeth that puts even those of sharks to shame. Their jaws sport not only one row of teeth but two, allowing it to shred flesh like thin paper. The pointy teeth seem to be built to pierce armor, natural or artificial. Their powerful arms can grapple most opponents with ease and their iron grip is hard to escape from. Of course being in the grip of their arms makes one prone to bites of their murderous teeth. \nThey mostly lack any climbing skill that other apes might display and actually seem rather clumsy, probably because of their sheer mass and muscles. The flesh of the Gorerilla is inedible and seems to mostly consist of tough meat due to their muscles, that is impossible to chew. The Gorerilla in turn, though capable of eating plant matter, relies on flesh and blood as sustenance mostly. They are very diligent when it comes to cleaning bones of even the slightest shred to flesh and leave the skeletons of their victims almost impossible clean. \nOnly their offspring has a diet of fruits, roots and insects mostly. They hide in the thickets where they compete with numerous other cubs of local creatures for a limited supply of food.",

They usually start with grain and livestock or occasionally some peasant who did not get away fast enough. Then they proceed with all other kinds of animals, insects and finally plants.

As long as they can cause pain and fear to living beings, they are also prepared to ally with other evil entities. The nature of these possessive spirits is currently disputed. The most popular theory implies that the spirits are actually some ancient race that never had any corporeal form other than that of possessed undead beings. They cloak their possessed bodies with rags, and they arm them with a scythe imbued with part of their own mystical energy. These scythes are known to rend horrible wounds that heal only slowly and often become infected. The scythes are nearly indestructible and are able to cut through any armor with ease. The worst thing about the reapers is that they cannot be killed for good. Even if the undead body is hacked into pieces, the possessing spirit escapes unharmed, ready to possess another undead body. Some Grim Reapers haunt their opponents again and again until they finally kill them.\nDread and fear are the things the spirits are looking for. It is assumed that the spirits feed on these emotions and also on pain and agony. For this reason, it is no surprise that Grim Reapers prefer places where they can inflict pain or fear.",

        "description": "The Grimeleech is a strange breed of demon that only recently surfaced. It seems that there was once an ancient demonic progenitor race of lesser demons which infested the demonic realm like vermin and survived on the garbage of higher demons. In the last few decades, this lesser demon vermin seemingly vanished completely and instead, the Grimeleech surfaced. Some self-proclaimed experts on demonology and zoology claim that the Grimeleech is somehow connected to the Hive creatures, but even they heatedly debate whether the Hive in some way infected the demons, or whether the demons absorbed some of the Hive's attributes. It is undeniable though that the Grimeleech breed soon left its mark in the ranks of demonkind. Especially their ability to harmoniously work together is a trait rarely seen in demons. The vast number of Grimeleeches spread out into different swarms led by powerful matriarchs. In something resembling a forced evolution, Grimeleeches grew significantly in power and importance in the demonic ranks. Other demons eye them suspiciously, and while some will not accept them as true demons at all, others are more concerned with where and when the Grimeleeches' increase in power and abilities might end. However, Grimeleeches usually stick to their own and mind their own sinister businesses. They inhabit the more unpleasant, least contested spaces in the demonic realms, and are highly territorial. \nOnly recently some demon lords have recognised their potential and tried to integrate them into their forces; and others soon followed so as not to leave a potential weapon solely at their rivals' disposal. The Grimeleech matriarchs seem unconcerned about sending some of their troops to assist the demonic leaders, if only for the fact that the little time and resource it costs to replace some fallen soldiers is of small consequence to them. The birth rates of the Grimleech can swell to enormous numbers if required by the matriarchs. How the demons really reproduce is shrouded in mystery, though. In combat, they show little regard for their own health and try to cause as much damage as possible. While the ordinary Grimeleeches seems to have little personality, and no ambition beyond serving their matriarchs, it would be wrong to say they enjoy the carnage and bloodshed they are often involved in. Instead, they are just frighteningly unconcerned and highly efficient. These facts make the Grimeleech a force to be reckoned with; and one that might further shake and change demonic society.",

They have the body, tail and back legs of a lion but the forelegs, head and wings of an eagle. \n\nIt is said that the entire continent was once given to them by the gods. But the Anuma conferred the dominance over Kilmaresh to the humans, in an effort to let them take responsibility of their own. However, after the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar and the cataclysm that severed the continent, the Anuma took the reign over Kilmaresh back - for the humans' own benefit as they said. It is said that out of all Anuma, the sun god Suon loved the gryphons most whereas his wild sister Fafnar favoured the manticores. \n\nGryphons mate for life and if either partner dies, the other will continue the rest of its life alone and never search for a new mate. They live very reclusive and love the high mountain peaks of Kilmaresh. In very rare cases, a gryphon will forge a bond with a human it regards worthy. If this happens, the gryphon will agree to carry the mortal on its back which is considered the highest possible honour by the people of Kilmaresh. \n\nAs gryphons are Suon's holy animals, the inhabitants of Kilmaresh decorate the sun god's temples with gilded gryphon eggs. To get the rare egg shells, chosen members of a temple will undertake a pilgrimage to the gryphon nests high in the Kilmaresh mountains. If they find a pair that recently hatched fledglings, they will offer presents to the parents and ask for the leftover egg shells. Mostly the gryphons benevolently agree and gift their now empty eggs to the human priests. The mortals will bring the egg shells to the respective temple, where the eggs are blessed, gilded on the inside and filled with onyx sand. Mostly they are used to hold incense sticks that are burned in the temples or gravesides. ",

A good part of their enormous brain patterns are dedicated to organizing, comparing, analyzing, evaluating and memorizing new and old knowledge.

They serve as the main copyists of Zathroth and are responsible for spreading certain knowledge while withholding other for the worthy. The guardians are zealous followers of Zathroth and as such developed their own, twisted philosophy around their teachings, so it's not uncommon for them to twist and alter texts that they produce to fill them with traps that will spell doom for the unwary and unworthy. One of their most prominent creation is that of a living, sentient runic alphabet. Those runes are able to spread like a disease amongst books and texts, change and subvert their contents and rumor has it, that it might even in some strange way may spread to sentient beings in some way. Though reclusive and more concerned about knowledge and service to Zathroth, when cornered or in service of forbidden knowledge the guardians are more then willing to engage in a fight. They use their knowledge to weave powerful spells and their only true weakness is, that they are way better in the theoretical application of their knowledge then the practical one. This leaves an opening at least for some highly skilled adventurer to weather their waves of attacks and pierce their wards and protections to overpower them. Defeating a guardian of tales though is not an easy task and surely none that pleases the god of forbidden knowledge.",

Harpies were mentioned in some of the earliest records of human myths and sometimes are featured in the myth of other creatures too. So the origin of these creatures is shrouded in the past. \nSince harpies are aggressive and vile creatures that attack settlements and abduct villagers to their nests, harpies are hunted and several times in history have seemingly been driven to extinction, just to resurface out of seemingly nowhere. Over the course of the centuries there have been several attempts to replicate harpies by using alchemy or magic. The results were of mixed successes but it seems there are a couple of master formulars making the round in certain circles, that allow a reliable creation of harpies. \nAs harpies are aggressive and destructive by nature, such experiments are usually done out of careless curiosity or with destructive intent. \nOnly a few scientists managed to breed harpy strains that were controllable by them to at least some extend. Again Dr. Marrow had outclassed his peers in this regard, which proves that his sophisticated techniques do more than a simple fusing of creatures on his whims. \nHarpies are intelligent but most never get a grasp at the concept of language or build anything more sophisticated than simple nests. Even the usage of tools is rare yet not unseen amongst harpies. \nThough there are some loners amongst them, most harpies prefer to band together in flocks that claim wide Swarts of land as their own territory in which they hunt indiscriminately and that they fiercely protect. Their common tactics against significantly smaller enemies is, to lift them into the air and drop them to death from a greater height. They try these tactics even on larger opponents. Though this proves ineffective, their nasty, sharp claws sill are able to cause grievous wounds during  such attempts.",

        "description": "While the Headpecker can survive all over Gnomprona, they seem to shun areas that are susceptible to the relatively common foul smelling sulphur clouds that are common in certain areas of the island. Their preferred habitats are located at places where the relatively constant wind drifts keep most of the sulphur away. \nAs many other predators seem keen on feasting on Headpecker eggs, their nests are well hidden and fiercely protected. Such protection is not limited to the parent creatures but all Headpeckers. It has to be assumed that the birds can somehow sense nearby nests, even of foreign Headpeckers and instinctively act accordingly.   \nThe creature is classified as the prime example how gnompronean creatures adapted to the environment over time. By many it is seen as the source of such theories. In fact fossils of the Headpecker and its ancestors were the major starting point for the first serious investigations and excavations to begin with. Through skeleton findings and excavations it could be traced how a relatively harmless, yet enormous bird evolved to such a threatening predator. \nThe bird-creature not only developed a quite lethal weapon in his hardened and pointy beak, it also learned instinctively to use it with utmost precision to aim at the weakest spots of an opponent. This mode of attack is seemingly aided by some strange sense to spot said areas. It's not clear if it is some enhanced form of an ordinary sense or an additional sensorial tool at their disposal. Its agility, ferocity and battle skills made the Headpecker a way more dangerous opponent then you'd expect from a mere too huge for its own good bird. \nThe Headpecker also seem to still have taken the niche that is usually occupied by other birds and smaller mammals in other environments. \nSome of the aforementioned fossils strongly suggest that the Headpecker evolved from a way smaller, airborne ancestor that once roamed the skies, probably long before the rise of other flying and more successful competitors for that niche. There is a string of skeletons and bones from different centuries with whose help the development can be traced with amazing precision. \nThe ancestor birds were not only smaller, but had way bigger wings, more fragile, hollow bones and a smaller, yet even more pointed beak. \nAs one of the prime examples of a creature that over time developed to switch its habitat for survival it holds an important spot in scientific theories and paved the way of further archaeological excursions and theories.",

In some of the demons the fire of hatred grows so strong that they are consumed by this inner, hellish fire. Some of them are powerful enough to fight back that urge for a while. They are equipped with hellish armors to contain the destructive energy that burns through them. They save their lives for the price of an existence in consuming and eternal pain, hatred and rage. Driven to the edge of madness and sometimes beyond, those demons love to release some of their anger and inner fire upon others. Exhaustive fight is their only way to find relief.

        "description": "Hellflayers have hitherto been rarely seen in the realms of mortals. While other demons are known for their sheer strength and destructive power, Hellflayers are more dreaded and revered for their malicious cunning. Usually, they prefer to stay in the demon strongholds and spend their time plotting and scheming, although they seem to be involved with the spreading of certain spells which allow mortals to call them into their world. If they are summoned, it is usually a specific Hellflayer that can be called, and instead of being used as a help in battle, they are more prized as advisors and teachers of the dark arts. The reason for their eagerness to be summoned might be related to the fact that they often offer blood pacts to their summoners, and serve as emissaries of darker powers. Their offers are forbidden knowledge about artefacts, skills and spells, and their demands vary from seemingly harmless and easy deeds in their service to claiming parts of the summoner's soul. Hellflayers often keep close contact to their summoners and lure them deeper and deeper into their dark web. This is commonly known among summoners, but the appeal of the power and knowledge the Hellflayers offer has been hard to resist for many a curious mind. And while only the most foolish believe themselves to be the master of their summoned creature, in the end many fall victim to the hidden snares the Hellflayers add to their deals and pacts.\n\nHellflayers aren't free from vanity of their own, though. They tend to see themselves as somewhat of the demonic aristocracy, courting the various demon lords and princes with their services. Though generally more interested in corrupting and enthralling mortals, their arsenal of spells makes them a formidable opponent if they are forced to fight. Especially the places they call home are fiercely protected. But even then, they prefer to rely on other demons to take the beating, and readily sacrifice them for their own survival. ",

Being worse than beast or demon, it combines the most fearsome and most dangerous traits of both kinds to an amalgam of fearsome power. Containing the malice and ferocity of three demons, the Hellhound uses the malignant abilities of its three heads to cause as much damage as it can.\nSaid to be three times meaner than the average hellbeast, its three heads are so frightening in their hellish rage that lesser men are said to have died already on sight of this walking menace of ichor and fangs. Sometimes one of these demon beasts is captured and trained by powerful demons to something that could be vaguely called a forced loyalty to their fearsome masters. As long as they respect their masters as the stronger one, they are relatively obedient. Still, nobody can tell when they might turn on their master or when they are driven into a frenzy that let them forget any bonds they might have shared. Hellhounds are known to get in such a rage that they not seldom heavily wound their own heads. Still large numbers of those beasts are bred and captured on order of several demonlords. They are as often employed to frighten an enemy or a rival as they are used as a status symbol to prove their might and disregard of danger ... and the lives of their other minions as well.",

If cornered, a Hellspawn will fight with a fearsome ferocity that uses the power and skills of both inherited species.\nPossessing demonic immortality, the Hellspawn usually outlives its original purpose and is then  abandoned by its creators. Hellspawns are often quite attached to their surrounding, and might stay in an area for decades or even centuries. Sometimes, however, they grow restless and start  to roam the world in search for a new territory. For this reason, it is possible to encounter a Hellspawn almost anywhere.",

In fact they originate as Humongous Fungi that are so evil that they begin to change and ultimately end in destroying themselves.Their evilness materialises as deformation and an inner rot that drives the fungus to the brink of insanity. Hideous Fungi seems to not care about planning and safety. They are by far more often encountered alone than their yet untainted kin. Sometimes they are found wandering aimlessly in remote tunnels, often chasing something that they forgot about a long time ago. While the Hideous Fungi use their physical and natural abilities as aptly as any of their kin, their attacks lack finesse and often seem utterly random and chaotic. Their only interest seems to be to do as much harm as possible. Where the Humongous Fungus simply evil, the Hideous Fungus is pure destruction. It is not known if the Hideous Fungus is aware of its demise getting closer or if it is pain that drives it to these merciless frenzies. What is certain is the fact that the fungus seems to be searching for death, almost provoking it. Only recently some daring explorers might have shed some light on this matter. Not only have they noticed that from the dead body of a Hideous Fungus a group of Humongous Fungi will grow after a while, but also that their victims often fall mysteriously ill and die, seemingly never recovering from the wound they got in a battle with a Hideous Fungus. So it might be entirely possible that the rampages of the Hideous Fungus, whether an act of planning or not, might be connected to the reproduction of the fungi of evil.",

The honey elemental never moves far away from its honey combs, as it has a strong and powerful connection to them. As it was born from a magically-enhanced honeycomb, the honey elemental feels an intrinsic attachment to them and considers them to be its nest and dwelling place.

Some time after coming of age they wander away to fall into a neverending slumber deep underground. Standing in pitch-black darkness, sleeping still, dreaming quaint dreams of death they await the time of joint uprising. Some are born to be chosen custodians of their siblings, awake and sentient.\n\nDue to a curse, they have undergone an incomplete metamorphosis and remain human. Their extreme determination and will to defend the Forest of Life, for example, stems from the fact that they deeply feel the need of all their siblings and will fight, if blindly, for their survival. Mumbling and full of aggressiveness. They can be described as deformed humans, connected to a complex hive mind.\n\nHulking carnisylvans have the strongest bark and endure an intangible amount of pain. Their attacks are devastating but they need to get close to their victims.",

        "description": "The discovery of the Hulking Prehemoth sent shockwaves through the entire scientific community. Especially it's unique bone structure turned many things taken for granted upside down. Many of the bones that were found in the deepest caves and the bowels of Tibia, for years have been assumed to be the fossilized remains of the modern Behemoths. Yet the recent discoveries in Gnomprona now hint that they rather belonged to the Hulking Prehemoths that once seemed to have roamed the whole depths of Tibia. It now seems likely that the Hulking Prehemoths arose in times when food was abundant in their native underground habitat. Later when such sources of nourishment became scarce, they were slowly replaced by their more specialised mineral-eating children. \nUnlike his descendant the ordinary Behemoth, who adapted mostly to a diet of minerals, the primal ancestor relies on a diet of flesh and bones. Some point out that their digesting of creatures as a whole ultimately enabled their offspring's adaption to a diet of minerals. As such scientists point out the difference of bones and minerals seems minor. \nIn Gomprona the Hulking Prehemoth is a comparatively peaceful creature. Though perfectly able to hunt for the bone and marrow it needs, it's relatively docile when well-fed. Yet given their sheer mass and muscle in fact they are rarely if ever well-fed aside from the controlled environment of captured Hulking Prehemoths. All attempts to tame the creatures resulted in utter and sometimes fatal failure so the gnomes gave up on wasting valuable crystals on such endeavours. \nThe area that currently houses operation challenger has been cut off from the main island by a relatively new lava stream. Said area seemingly was the breeding and hatching ground of the local Prehemoths population and it has yet to be seen how the Hulking Prehemothes adapt to this - or if the lava foreshadowed their inevitable extinction. As for now the Hulking Prehemoth population has suffered and competing creatures prospered, but slowly the number of Behemoth's seem to be stabilising and reaching a new equilibrium.",

And some are good while others are utterly evil. The Humongous Fungus belongs to the latter category. Each of them is driven by sinister impulses of malignant evil. Even a Humongous Fungus starts out small, though. Far too small for the evil they contain, they are mischievous creatures that enjoy harassing and tormenting other creatures. They often lay simple traps for the unwary, steal things or destroy food. While a nuisance as long as they are small, the true threat arises when they grow in size and strength. If that happens, the former loners band together in groups and become a destructive force to be reckoned with. There seems little that hey fear in numbers, although they seem to not care much about a fallen comrade. With no regard for their own safety, they attack everything that promises a good deal of destruction and pain. Through their raw powers they would be a formidable threat already, additionally they also have several disturbing mushroom powers at their disposal that are usually used more instinctively then planned. It actually seems unlikely that they can control their abilities at all. Though they enjoy killing and slaughtering, they sometimes take prisoners and torture them in their lairs that they often create in some remote caves. Only there they seem to pursue their only non-evil pastime: singing. With their lovely baritone voices they are able to produce melodies of astonishing beauty. Their lead singers are usually the most humongous of the bunch. Since they are highly territorial it has become common for underground explorers to mark caves in which fungi singing was heard as a warning to other travellers.",

This is only one of the reasons why most encountered Ice Golems are hostile. Another less known fact is that the structure of the Ice Golem's feeble mind makes it easy for all kinds of spirits to possess these creatures and to take over control. Thus the Ice Golems are easy to be 'ridden' by such entities and especially malignant spirits have little qualms to do so.\nThe strength and resilience of Ice Golems is quite similar to other golems. They tend to be a bit faster and more agile compared to stone golems but are not that heavily armoured. They are only able to survive in cold climate as Ice Golems will melt in warmer regions unless some kind of magic is applied to prevent this. In cooler areas it is much easier to raise Ice Golems than their stone cousins. As a rule of thumb, Ice Golems are usually encountered in greater numbers than  stone golems.",

Therefore they bound powerful spirits of frost and ice into their tomes. The levitating books accompanied them as companions and tools at once. With the vanishing of their creator race, the icecold books became inert. Hungry for the knowledge contained in them, they were stolen and experimented upon. The only way found to unleash their considerable power, was to empower them with a will of their own and bind certain arcane crystals attuned to icemagic into them as an energy source. Thus the books became self-sustained entities that had access to at least some of the ancient spells bound to them. They follow an icecold, yet somewhat malignant logic and can be reasoned with to some degree. Since their creators seemed to have had some deeper connection to Zathroth, they easily ally with his forces. Still they act on their own and might behave strongly unpredictable. Almost indistinguishable from them are newer creations that were attempts to recreate them with modern magic. Though less powerful and less intelligent, these copies are highly obedient to their creators but contain no bound knowledge on their own. Instead they use an array of frost abilities that work more with a brute force method than artfully woven magic like the originals. They are used to provide a reliable source of ice magic, that doesn't drain the mana reserves of its owner. Both versions can be found as status symbols of powerful casters. It is said that a high number of originals was collected and stored away by followers of Zathroth but even they were unable to unlock the final secret knowledge contained in them.",

Mostly oblivious to the hostile environment and haughty with the self-image of superiority, these demons fear nothing and no one and see themselves as the new rulers of the realm by right, born out of might. Little do they know yet, about the transforming horrors that await them and will erode even their arrogance. For now they delight the torture and mayhem that they can wreak in the plane, seemingly mostly unsupervised by their superiors. More often than not those superiors used the assignment to Zarganash as a method to get rid of troublemakers and malcontents of all kinds. Of course this leads to high levels of internal power struggles and its quite common that small cabals are formed to acquire some temporary power, only to be on each other's throats as soon they notice the slightest weakness of their so-called allies. While evil and treacherous in their core anyway, the madness that gets an ever growing hold on them makes them dangerous even to their own kind. While they retain their conscience they more and more become victims of sudden urges, ideas that are not entirely their own but the whispers of the realm itself. Once a demon has stayed for some time in Zarganash he is no longer welcome amongst their outside brethren and not allowed to leave. As the demonic hierarchy uses assignments to Zarganash as a means to dispose unwanted minions in a subtle and sinister way, sooner or later the consequences of an assignment to Zarganash become obvious. The more the infernal demons become aware of their abandonment, the more they indulge in orgy's of destruction and rage, often aimed at new arrivals in the realm. Whatever the original purpose of their mission might have been, it has long become meaningless to them and most of them are actively sabotaging the efforts of their former masters out of sheer spite - at least this is what they perceive as their motivation.\n\nOver time most infernal demons become permanently bound to Zarganash and transform into brachiodemons.

        "description": "Zarganash's hostile environment gave birth to an own breed of phantom that differs by the hazards that help to form them from the tormented souls they once were. The infernal phantom absorbed that much demonic energy that there is little to distinguish them from demons at all. With demonic incursion in Zarganash the amount to demonic residue has increased dramatically and what was once a rare occurrence is now a common sight in certain areas. Though their form follows that of other phantoms for all other regards they are more a demon than ghost. Yet as anything, Zarganash got a hold of, they can never break free from the realm and are trapped not only in the depths of the nether realms but also in their accursed state of ghostly denizens of Zarganash. Some described them as demonic entities trapped in ghostly bodies but in the end it's only a twisted mimicry that drives them. Ironically their emulation of demonic cruelty and behaviour doesn't differentiate them much from other phantoms at all. The key difference towards demons is that they lack any allegiance to the demonic hoards and the essence that fuels them is something entirely different. In combat their comparatively high intelligence and awareness is set off by their hatred and anger. Though in theory they are some of the more stable and intelligent phantom breeds, there is little chance for any meaningful conversation. Even if outnumbered and cornered, the infernal phantom will still attack suicidal instead of participating in negotiation. It is said though that stealthy observers witnessed gatherings of infernal phantoms in which they conversed with hushed voices in conspiratorial manner. If this hints to any greater plan or agenda of these phantoms or if it's just another mimicry of the demons is yet unknown.",

Instead of waiting for the apocalypse to come, they actively aim for their goal of total destruction.\nThough Infernalists used to be eager students of magic, they discarded a good deal of spells in their repertoire in favour of more destructive and flashy spell effects. It is surely not astonishing that their favourite element is fire, as these spells are not only highly destructive put also have some glamorous effects.\nInfernalists are easily won over for any task that causes destruction. They lack any form of patience though and often leave one job to join another. Several Infernalists work as mercenaries and some even find employment in armies. However, their short temper and their eagerness to start arguments about minor incidents make them bad employees. Even the cults they belong to are not very fond of them. For this reason, they are often sent on dangerous or even suicidal missions in the hope that they will never return. Despite all the destruction they have caused and enemies they have made, in the end, most Infernalists die either of their own machinations like destroying a building they are still in, or at the hands of allies that want to get rid of them.",

        "description": "It is said said great authors put a part of their hearts, sweat, blood and souls into their masterpieces. This is often more than true for works on arcane knowledge. Some works become like entities on their own and begin to feed on the energy of their creator. Sometimes they consume even more energy than a mere arcane book can contain. Such overloaded books begin to 'bleed' out some of the lifeblood and essence they contain in the form of magic ink. While a single book can merely produce some inconsequential droplets of soul-ink, a large number of books that provide such ink might pool into a greater blob. This combined essence quickly gains a form of sentience of their own and feeds on lesser pools to grow in size and power. Since they become very protective towards the books that spawned them and they still feel some kind of mystical connection to, they are usually rather seen as useful than just a mere nuisance, though they are always quite hostile towards strangers. Since in theory they can absorb unlimited amounts of essence pools and grow to abominably sizes, they are commonly culled by the keepers of the libraries that spawn them and split into lesser, better manageable blobs of smaller size. The refreshment of fading inks in old books, destruction of vermin as well as mold and keeping the pages at the ideal state of dryness counts to their more usual functions. They tend scare away some nosy intruders and keep visitors out of areas they are unwanted in. While relatively 'newborn' ink blobs are timid and react to strangers with scary faces and bubbly noises older, more experienced blobs, become considerably more aware of their own capabilities and grow more and more aggressive and malignant.",

There seem to be two distinctively different kinds of dream-born, that align themselves with either the winter or the summer. Though there are conflicting reports about that alignment, the current theory is that there are two rivaling courts exists though it's still possible that there is just one court that changes in accordance to the seasons. In the few recorded encounters, the dream-born claimed to live in realms that their god created with his dreams. Given their obvious kinship to the common elves it's of course far more likely that they are just descendants of elves that fled the godwars into some kind of pocket dimension. They usually shun outsiders and rarely leave their own realm at all. What little information could be gathered about them suggests a lifestyle akin that of the other elves, though they seem to lack a cast system and have a feudal oriented society. Due to their isolation they developed odd quirks like the overemphasising of seasons, that hints at a primitive, animistic world-view. It's still recommended to improve any contact and further the knowledge about them for the sake of science. All research of their behalves is hampered by what some kind of disease that drives them mad and violent. The dream-born claim that this is caused by 'nightmares' which may hint that a feverish episode is the precursor of this madness. Although this disease seemingly does not spread to other species, it is still recommended to keep these aggressive lunatics at distance. This behavior gives new credit to the old saying: If bitten by an elf, please see your doctor. \nThe sirens of the summer court are the bloodthirsty elite of those that were overcome by the nightmares. Whatever their combat role might have been in their previous life, after they 'turned' they became a veritable threat that is hellbent on the utter destruction of an enemy. Using all weapons, spells and abilities at their disposal, they show the most tactical abilities of all crazed dream-born. Even amongst the other maddened elves they seem to command a certain amount of respect and authority for all that might be worth. They are often the leaders of onslaughts on intruders but also on attacks on the fortifications of uninfected dream-born. Don't be fooled though, they are not to be reasoned with. Any discussion they seem to engage in only has the ultimate goal to allow reinforcements to arrive or the enemy to be circled. ",

Some of the more aggressive insects though already pose a threat by their sheer number. Such swarms can be encountered almost everywhere, however, usually they are attracted by places of decay. The term Insect Swarm describes a common threat. While not strictly evil, Insect Swarms are often aggressive and dangerous. One of the greatest dangers of an Insect Swarm is that it can be encountered almost everywhere and often unexpectedly. Sometimes, rather harmless insects form swarms out of coincidence and disperse after a while. However, if someone provokes the forming of such swarm, he better prepares for the worst. Attracted to blood and decay, Insect Swarms are often drawn to weakened creatures that might even fall under their attacks.",

After several skirmishes of the creatures with Tibian natives, a few things about them can be considered as verified facts. The Insectoid Scouts are not aggressive in the sense that they are attacking towns or settlements, instead, they are usually found in rather remote areas. When encountered though, they are rather violent and attack everyone relentlessly. Despite their build, they are rather tough and extremely strong. Their behaviour suggests that they are looking for something or spying on someone. This behaviour earned them the nickname 'scouts', and military officials of the major powers are all concerned that they might be indeed forerunners for something bigger and more sinister.",

        "description": "Due to their versatility and resilience, the Insectoid Workers are the most commonly encountered of the Hive Born. They seem to be relatively expendable and are used as foragers and scouts in the widest sense. They test the strength of their enemies and sometimes, they are sent in great numbers to bring down a dangerous foe without risking the more valuable warriors. Usually the  Insectoid Workers are chosen to become one with the hive structures to grant them their unnatural life. As expendable creatures they are encountered quite often, but their brethren show little regard for them. It has been observed in battles that they are devoured by wounded hive creatures to regain strength.\nThey seem to depend less on the hive than other Hive Born. Although they lose strength and health when away from the hive, they survive for extended periods and so they are for now the only Hive Born that have been encountered elsewhere in the world. It is assumed that their appearance might serve the creation of new hives but so far no new hive has been established. In the hive area, they are often paired with waspoids in scouting missions and hit and run tactics.\nIn the war of the hive against the Deeplings, the Insectoid Workers are the most basic troops. Although not as numerous as the swarmers, they usually last longer and are used at more critical points of interest. They often attack in concert with the swarmers and seem quite proficient to pick and take down wounded opponents. Like fearless soldiers led by a general, the Insectoid Workers march side by side, knowing no fear and ignoring wounds and casualties. It is their lack of emotion and passion that makes their advances so frightening.",

They also emit magnetic fields of their own, sometimes moving iron-rich earth and stones seemingly at will. In the right surroundings, Ironblights can even walk on walls and ceilings. Oddly enough, their prolonged proximity to iron lets it rust at an unnatural rate. Therefore dwarfs are particularly interested in keeping the Ironblights away. In the past, successful extermination campaigns have eradicated Ironblight presences from their mines for quite a while. The Ironblights are usually as patient and slow as the stone they resemble, only to surprise the incautious with bursts of speed and aggression from one second to the next. The Ironblights are immensely irritated by the magnetic fields that most sentient beings seem to emit. The highly sensitive creatures experience pain and agony in the vicinity of people. Yet this seems to kick in only at a certain low range, far too late to avoid the cause of discomfort. Therefore Ironblights often threaten bases of underground dwellers. Young gnomes had the habit of challenging each other as to who can catch the attention of an Ironblight from furthest away compared to the others, just to prove who is smarter. This rather unwise practice has been forbidden to gnomes by law and promotional campaigns with slogans like 'it is not at all smart to challenge death by teasing Ironblights'.",

Because of their strong legs, with which they can move quickly on land, one might think that moas are incapable of flight. In fact, however, they are good flyers and prefer to build their nests in the high mountainous areas of the island. Moas are herbivores and feed mainly on buds, leaves and the fruits of jungle plants. Unusual for birds of this size, many moas have a preference for shiny or glittering objects. If they spot these and can snatch them without major risk, the birds will often steal such items and hide them in their nests. Moa eggs are of an intense red colour, which is why the shells are popularly used by the nagas of Marapur for jewellery and decorations. Both, moa eggs and meat, are also a popular source of food for the mountain nagas. ",

Once rather harmless caimans, today resilient beasts - the selection changed them according to the whims of their lizard masters. In ancient times, the caiman breeding was a pastime of the royalty and a strong caiman was a vital prestige object. Caiman battles were arranged to show off and to settle conflicts. Over the years, caimans escaped or were given as present to loyal subjects who set them free or interbred them with escaped beasts. This way, they slowly found their way back into the wilds. Later lower caste lizards captured them and they became widespread pets.\nThe Killer Caiman that is found nowadays in Zao has surpassed its ancestors in all ways. As if they weren't already dangerous enough, the royalty of the lizard people still possesses caiman hatcheries where they breed even stronger and more resilient versions of the Killer Caiman.",

It is said that even minor books leak their knowledge a little. If enough books in an area leak such knowledge, it interacts with other sublime knowledge in an area. Eventually the concentration of knowledge leads to the existence of what in lack of better terms is called a knowledge elemental. It is raw knowledge and power set free. It has only a mockery of sentience, truly no more than an irritating and misleading mirroring of knowledge fragments. The knowledge has only one purpose: to be known. Yet it's heavily fractured and raw, not fathomable to an ordinary mind at all. In their attempts to insert itself to others, the knowledge elemental becomes an aggressive threat, as it attempts are harmful and even lethal. The sudden outbursts of knowledge are disrupting and destructive, often taking the shape of spell-like effects. Magicians usually have to exorcise such manifested knowledge from their libraries. Given the relative commonness at certain areas, many libraries accept them as a given and rather use spells to ward them away from their bodies, instead of dispersing them. Though such wards are relatively complicated they are usually permanent and less of an effort than to fight knowledge manifestations again and again. As it occurs an area can only sustain a given number of knowledge elementals at all, so if one manifested another is highly unlikely. A place that could create more then a few knowledge elementals at a time, would have to contain absurdly high levels of knowledge and can be discarded to the realm of pure fantasy and wishful thinking of knowledge seekers and cultists.",

Their armor seems almost impenetrable and when they begin to move and gain some momentum, they are near to unstoppable. Astonishingly, their enormous carapace is hollow to a great extent. Sometimes, material or even smaller hive creatures are transported in these hollow spots. On other occasions, they transport eggs or nourishing goo under their carapace. Is is rumoured that the hollow carapace enables them to float on the water and serves other Hive Born as makeshift raft, but such reports are rare and rather dubious. Until now, no one has encountered a Kollos away from the hive so such rumours are probably just exaggerations. On rare occasions, though, it has been at least observed that a group of Kollos builds bridges or ladder-like structures with their bodies which are used as passage by other Hive Born.\nAnother observation seems more disturbing, though: Sometimes it seems that the Hive Born fight more coordinated and almost strategically intelligent when they are close to certain Kollos. This led to speculations that another, still undiscovered, hive creature might ride the Kollos from the inside and commands its brethren. However, until now, no Kollos that has been defeated had harboured such a creature.\nIn the constant war against the Deeplings, the Kollos are only of little use. Unable to dive or navigate very narrow passages, they are primarily used to repel the advances of the Deeplings. Here they serve the other Hive Born as tanks and shields while inflicting massive damage upon opponents careless enough to get into their reach.",

When left alone to mind their own business, they tend the eggs, repair the delicate structures of the hive and feed other Hive Born creatures with biomass. They do this quite peacefully and without any haste or urgency. When confronted with strangers, though, the Ladybugs show an aggressiveness that rivals that of their bigger brethren and belies their unassuming appearance. They are probably the least dangerous of the Hive Born and are quite territorial. Ladybugs live only for about a week and decay quite fast into a mass that can be easily devoured by other hive creatures or absorbed by the hive. Sometimes they sacrifice themselves and die seemingly on purpose to heal wounded hive structures. Astonishingly enough, unlike other hive creatures, Ladybugs show no great difference in their behaviour when separated from the hive for an extended period of time. While other creatures become increasingly aggressive and eventually mutilate themselves or simply wither and die, the Ladybugs show no such behaviour. Quite the contrary, Ladybugs separated from the hive are reported to live considerably longer and behave more like the common giant bugs. That lets scientists believe that Ladybugs may not be hive creatures per se but a creature that lives in some kind of symbiosis with the hive. Only occasionally, Ladybugs take part in the war against the Deeplings, mainly when the hive needs to be defended.",

But the Anuma conferred the dominance over Kilmaresh to the humans, in an effort to let them take responsibility of their own. However, after the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar and the cataclysm that severed the continent, the Anuma took the reign over Kilmaresh back - for the humans' own benefit as they said.\n\nLamassu are willing to assist mortal creatures in combat, if they are convinced that those under their protection are worthy and pure of heart. They never shy away from a conflict and will fight to the last breath rather than to retreat or surrender. Lamassu are capable of flight yet prefer to stay on the ground, roaming Kilmaresh's steppe and - more often - ruins. They prefer deserted cities and abandoned temples as their homesteads. Some lamassu even live underground to guard old graveyards and catacombs. They regard themselves as wardens of those ancient sacred sites and won't tolerate any disturbance or sacrilege. ",

For unknown reason though, at certain times, they unite to build enormous swarms to devastate whole areas with their ravenous hunger. Guided by an unseen force, they crawl together even from the most remote spots. Without an apparent leader or queen, they seem to share a unique instinct and will to devour and destroy. Usually such swarms are met with resistance by the natives, and sharp battles for survival are fought against such swarms. Often enough, such fights can be compared with an attempt to stop a river with bare hands though. The sheer number of the beetles ready to replace one of their slain kin seems endless.

Pictograms can be found in some places which show a civilised octopus-like race which apparently once dwelt in the deep. On those portrayals the race is served by creatures that look like the Lava Golems we know today. It seems the Lava Golems were once creations, servants or pets of that long extinct race. The fact that the Lava Golems of our time are now in service of 'those below' can be interpreted in many ways. Given the facts, it is most likely that the octopus creatures were conquered and annihilated by 'those below' and their creatures enslaved by the vile conquerors. Now the Lava Golems serve as faithful and unquestioning minions of their new masters. The Lava Golems are astonishingly passionless in their duty, usually doing nothing more than they were ordered to do. They quite obviously lack the destructiveness and rage that seems inherent in the other servants of 'those below'.

        "description": "The lava lurker seems like a creature just created for mayhem and destruction. It's a creature that seems to be in a constant, highly agitated frenzy, hell-bent on hurting, destroying and devouring. Though arguably more an elemental then a creature the lurker is mostly encountered close to volcanic activity, some even claim to be born or created by it. Despite it's aggressive nature it can become dormant for an unknown time and even blend it with other lave or magma environment being perfectly camouflaged. It's unknown it's actively lurks for prey in this state or becomes somehow awake as soon as a potential victim comes close but the outcome is the same. The lava lurker coms into action and viciously attacks every potential victim like the raging fire that might have given birth to it. With no obvious organs it is unknown how lukers feed. Due to their eagerness to burn and sear thing, it's assumed that ashes of organic matter gives then some sort of sustenance. Though it's theorized that the lurker reproduces like the common slime, this is only wild speculation and not backed up by any evidence at all. The whole comparisons to slimes might be highly misleading and create more questions than it provides answers. \nHow exactly they fit into the rooster of those bellow is also highly speculative. Some evidence suggest that their appearance might only be a side effect of the heat that comes with the advance of the hordes from bellow. Yet they mostly show no aggression towards the forces of those bellow, they are rarely part of attacks on outposts and when they do, it's almost more as if they are some force of nature then part of an army. \nThis puts their whole sentience into question. Scientists and sorcerers that are fascinated by this creature but are just on the brink of their studies of the lava lurker. Only time will tell what valuable lessons can be made by their analysis. Given the destructive nature of the lava lurker though, a steep price might have to be paid in that process. ",

The fungi are a somewhat civilised race that allied with Those Below for their own sinister purposes, The lavafungi obviously propagate in the deepest bowels of earth where its usually so hot, that they are never encountered by races not accustomed to such an intense heat. Only recently, howevr, they have been forced to leave their breeding grounds and to join the forces of Those Below. The constant exposure to an environment that is significantly too cold for their taste puts the already dangerous lavafungi into a constant bad mood that they tend to vent off on their opponents. The fungi that are encountered in battle are only the lowest ranking members of their race and there are hints that colonies of more advanced lavafungi exist in the realm of Those Below. It is speculated that the fungi that are part of the army and advance forms are part of a lower, less educated caste of the fungi and the 'real' lavafungi wield sophisticated weaponry and armour. The lava fungi encountered in the armies of Those Below are seen as disposable and easily replaced.\nThey are often used as garrison forces rather than as shock troops. Lava fungi are often seen in undertaking manual labour in garrisons and camps, to which they are more suited then most other subterranean minions. In greater depth and at locations of great heat they completely replace the lost as a workforce. All in all their relationship with the lost seems strained at best for some unknown reason, though it has been observed that the lost consider fallen fungi as a delicacy.\nEspecially in recent times there was a surge of lava fungi troops in the armies of Those Below. It seems that the upper casts of the fungi have decided to take a more active role in the war. The reason for this paradigm shift is completely unknown, as so much concerning Those Below their allies and their minions.",

        "description": "The lavawarom is a creature of the deepest depths of Tibia. Not only does this creature survive the deepest and hottest places in Tibia, it thrives in it. Deep probes of the gnomes proved that there are countless lava pools, virtually brimming with lavaworms of all sizes. Though probably a very distant cousin of the rotworm, the lavaworm has little in common with its supposed relative. The lavaworm comes in several sizes but the smaller, juvenile speciems can't survive outside of their lava pools for long and the larger versions seem to loose heath too fast and are prone to become immobile stone structures until they gain enough internal heat and shed their outer stone-shell. Only the adolescent lavaworms leave their pools regularly and are herded into the armies of Those Below. They are as aggressive as many minions of Those Below, but lose interest in a fight easily and sometimes even seem to forget what they are doing. They make only weak additions to the troops as they often wander off, are easily distracted and too dumb to understand the concept of an enemy. They become somewhat more effective when they are settled to a specific area where they might serve as a kind of guard dogs or just bolster occupation forces. Gnomish intelligence suggest that lavaworms often serve as emergency rations for other minions of Those Below and that pools of lavaworms are often raided for food and resources by them. An often overlooked threat is that wandering minion armies of Those Below often leave behind straggling lavaworms in certain areas, where they sometimes settle and reproduce. So in the wake of the underground wars several new pockets of lavaworm colonies were created, that are not periodically grazed by other creatures. While gnomish and dwarfish forces exterminate any nests they stumble upon, countless hidden lava areas are already inhabited by huge numbers of displaced lava worms.",

        "description": "Leaf Golems are a compilation of twigs, leaves and bark that are inhabited by lesser spirits of nature. Sometimes the spirits create the golems on their own, to act as a vehicle or tool to interact with the physical world. More often, though, Leaf Golems are spirits that have been bound into such constructs by some druidic power. Mighty druids often employ the help of leaf golems spontaneously. They are created on the fly and are often discarded when a task has been performed. Such discarded golems frequently disassemble on their own and the spirit is set free, but sometimes they decide to roam the world on their own. Leaf Golems are intelligent, but their thinking is based on the spiritual world and completely alien to the denizens of the physical world. Therefore it is impossible to communicate with them in any form. As spirits they seem to care little for the integrity of a physical body, and they often seek to destroy living beings, presumably to set their seemingly entrapped spirit free. Even though they may mean no real harm, their attacks are threatening and lethal nonetheless.\nThe leaf golem is a random and undecided fighter, oblivious to what might be most effective in a given situation. On the other hand, it knows little fear and does not truly understand how to stay out of harm's way.\nSometimes, druids who feel their life force waning and their end drawing near choose to transfer their spirits into a prepared Leaf Golem. These golems are considerably more powerful, but it is said that the inhabiting druid will eventually lose his grasp on the physical world and become a nature spirit on his own. ",

The liodile is both known for either lying in wait for potential prey or hunting in small packs.

Yet they are still occasionally preying on fellow mutants and probably more by accident than design keep the population of Dr. Marrows experimental specimens at bay and relatively stable. \nAs in natural occurring hybrids, the reproduction of Marrow's earliest creations was impossible. The mad yet determined scientist had his first breakthrough in that regard with the creation of the liodiles. Only later he retroactively altered the creation process of most of his other mutants with his new found knowledge. \nCuriously enough, the liodiles can fertilise themselves and propagate by laying eggs. \nThey shallowly burry the eggs and leave them unattended, seemingly oblivious of their meaning. Liodile eggs are often stolen by other predatory creature and only a few of them are lucky and fertile enough to hatch an offspring. Liodile offspring more closely resembles its crocodile ancestors in the first few months and mature in shallow waters, were they are again targeted by bigger predators. \nMatured liodiles are regularly rounded up by boar men patrols and brought back to the laboratory area, where they are raised and trained to fit into the mutant society.",

It seems that of all parts of lizard society, the priesthood changed the most due to the arrival of the dragons. In the last few decades, the old customs seem to have been forgotten if not suppressed, and an entirely new tradition was founded. Today, there is hardly any knowledge left about the dragons' predecessors.\nAlthough the Lizard Dragon Priests are a rather young order, they have been taught powerful magic by their dragon masters. Their skill in manipulating fire is rivalled only by few in the known world, and they enjoy conflagrations just like ritual arson. Still, the flame is seen only as one visual manifestation of the power of the dragons. Instead, they often use stylised dragons or items that have a relation to dragons as symbols for their belief. In their behaviour, the Lizard Dragon Priests try to emulate the dragons which is often mirrored in their fighting style.\nHowever, the powers of the Lizard Dragon Priests do not only encompass the calling of flames and blazes. Some of their apparent powers are not related to their reverence of the dragons. Whether their affinity to poison and corruption is a reminiscent of the past or somehow related to the dragons is still a mystery. Astonishingly enough for a culture so bound to traditions and formalism, the priesthood lacks proper ranks and offices. Instead an individual Lizard Dragon Priest may by skill or intrigues create its own individual office.",

        "description": "Lizard High Guards are hand-picked former members of the legions who showed great talent or had proven themselves in battle. These individuals were schooled in advanced tactics and put to a series of challenging tests. Joining the Lizard High Guards is a secret ceremony that takes place on the Isle of Strife. It is rumoured that the candidates do not only face several creatures in the arena but also have to battle their inner demons to prove themselves worthy. With the decline of the empire and the dwindling numbers of lizards, these tests became less and less lethal. Still, failure is seen as a dire disgrace and once these unlucky individuals are back in the legions they often seek death in battle to escape their shame.\nThe Lizard High Guards are the elite troops of the empire and fiercely loyal to their superiors following their strict code of honour. Their pride and honour let them stick to any given task, regardless how futile their mission may seem. Failure is no option for a Lizard High Guard. In the army, the Lizard High Guards form an almost monastic order with rituals and an ever present code of behaviour. The ideal Lizard High Guard is expected to be an example of absolute control over its mind and body. Lizard High Guards on ceremonial watch are known to remain so motionless that they could easily pass as statues.   The Lizard High Guards are perfectly aware of their elite status in the society and they look on the ordinary legionnaires with contempt.",

        "description": "Even the lowest members of the lizard army had to complete a rigorous training. Once the vast armies of the lizard people ruled the land of Zao with an iron fist. They had freed the lands from long forgotten competitors and efficiently eradicated each major threat for the empire. Each new menace was faced by the well-trained army led by elite generals. Even when the lizard people ruled unchallenged for centuries, their legions were not allowed to disregard their training. Bound to ancient traditions, their training continued under the rules set by the founders of the empire. The training has lost little of its harshness in the course of centuries.\nA Lizard Legionnaire is only responsible to army members of higher ranks. A position in the legion is one of prestige, and even though they are still at the mercy of their superiors, it is a step to relative freedom because a place in the army saves the Lizard Legionnaire from the influence of the many bureaucrats of the empire.\nFor a long period in the lizard people's history, the legions were only useful for parades and guardian duties. Still, when the great plague and the rise of the lizard people's enemies threatened the empire, the legions stood ready but saw themselves heavily outnumbered. During hasty recruitments, auxiliary troops were raised from the remaining population. But even fitted out with the best equipment, those untrained troops perished by dozens. Only the restocking of the legion ranks proved effective. With the stabilisation of the empire by the might of the dragons, the legions finally got the vitally needed time to refill their ranks and slowly managed to hold the status quo on their own. Still, the empire lacks Lizard Legionnaires to regain lost territory and looks for other means to strengthen its power.",

        "description": "For centuries, the Lizard Zaoguns were the elite of the lizard armies. They were hand-picked from the best of the best the nobility had to offer. Rigorous training honed their skills. Ancient and secret teachings in the arts of fighting and tactics prepared them well for their positions as officers and generals in the vast armies of old. With the arrival of the dragons and with them also the Draken, the star of the Lizard Zaoguns began to fade. Gradually, Draken took over the positions the Lizard Zaoguns once held. The proud Lizard Zaoguns were reduced to mere subordinates.\nOften nothing more than messengers for the Draken, the Lizard Zaoguns became embittered and their traditions started to change. The teachings about tactics became less and less important. The focus of their fighting training switched from an artful form containing ancient traditions and rituals to a much more aggressive and self-endangering style. The modern Lizard Zaoguns are elite warriors with little regard for their own safety. Their whole life is centred around triumph and spectacular victories. With acts of almost foolish bravery, they want to proof their value in a society that cares little about them. They seek the recognition of the dragon kings and the emperor with all means at their disposal. Though they are loyal to the dragons, they feel envy and anger towards the Draken who they see as usurpers of their rightful position.",

        "description": "In stark contrast to the silent and emotionless thrower, the Basher is bred to behave like a fierce animal. Their sounds and their berserk behaviour often give the impression to be fighting a kind of kongra in a dwarf's body. Though the basher employ a variety of killing utensils with frightening skill, those seem strangely out of place in their hands. Generally, they daunt their enemies with grunting noises and threatening posture, before charging and unleashing their full ferocity on the battlefield. Bashers are usually the first to charge into battle - as a matter of fact, the Bashers seem almost incapable of engaging into battle without a charge - accompanied by yells that cannot mistaken for ordinary battle cries. In combat, they continue their unnerving bawling and intimidating behaviour, although they frequently display a certain cunning and seem to enjoy slowly bleeding their enemies to death rather than swiftly finishing them off. Sometimes, however, they fly into an animal frenzy, dealing out a series of vicious and brutal blows that betray their immense strength. Moreover, the bashers seem to possess an uncanny sense of direction; and since both their mindset and their senses are animal-like, they are often used as guides, trackers or hunters by the Lost, although they are easily distracted.\nIt is not uncommon for bands of Bashers to follow their prey like bloodhounds, chasing them to death, often without any assistance of other Lost. Whether they have been dispatched by some superiors or follow some kind of hunting urge is subject to speculation. Dwarfs who wander around on their own, for instance scouts of soldiers cut off from their units, frequently become subjects of such hunts. The few survivors tell horrible stories about being chased by the bloodthirsty packs and in most stories, only the fact that another victim distracted the bashers, saved the lives of the fugitive.",

        "description": "The Husher is what comes closest to a magic-using shaman in the ranks of the Lost. Rather instinctively, and probably by having watched their ominous superiors working spells, they acquired some form of magic on their own. This led to a unique mixture of magic types which magic theorists would deem impossible, yet surprisingly enough yields results. Their magic is in no way subtle, and they probably regard it as some kind of divine wonder, rather than a product of their own actions. It is unknown whether Hushers are able to use more than the battle magic that has been observed. Given the nature of the Lost, it seems unlikely that they developed some other use of their mystical gifts, but as with so much else concerning the Lost, as they have only been encountered in battle and captives could not be reasoned with, little is known about their home and culture. Besides their magic, the Hushers are as wild and bloodthirsty as any other Lost, although some more planning and smartness can be attested to them. They are extremely resilient to pain, and part of their semi-religious acts seems to involve ritually cutting off their own skin, and scorching themselves with hot irons. Their simple religion seems centred on suffering and worship of everything that is associated with fire, heat and lava. For some reason, their magic bears an extreme affinity to smoke rather than fire itself. The intricacies of their belief system, if one exists at all, and how they teach each other their techniques, are still puzzling given the violent and animal behaviour of the Lost. It has to be assumed that somewhere in the depths of the earth where the Lost are bred, there is something like a Lost community with at least rudimentary structures, which allow them some kind of cultural identity and teaching of skills that go deeper than the mere animal-like drill which the fighting forces of the Lost seem to receive.",

Usually they haunt crypts, graveyards or places of torture and great pain.Sometimes though, these Lost Souls are snatched away by demons and forced into their service by the use of magical powers. Although the demons do not consider the Lost Souls as really useful, they enjoy to have an incarnation of suffering and pain around. Some of the more powerful and cruel demons even enjoy to 'breed' such ghosts on their own.

        "description": "One of the most single-minded Lost yet encountered, the Thrower is often compared to some kind of insect by its dwarven enemies. The Thrower knows no fear, no mercy and no change of plans. It seems as if, once they have made up their minds or are herded to some aim, they are only to be stopped by death or by fulfilling their agenda. Though lacking the ferocity and aggression of their brethren, they share or even surpass their mercilessness, and their zombie-like dispassion forms an irritating contrast to the madness and bloodlust generally encountered in other Lost. The first assumption, that they were the raised dead of former battles, could be refuted, but the throwers seem to be completely broken in spirit and soul. It is pointless, however, to wonder whether they were broken for having a rebellious spirit, or if the raising in the slave pens do this to some of the Lost by default. The outcome is yet another killing machine at the disposal of the Lost hordes.\nWhereas other Lost bloodthirstily charge at the enemy ranks to engage them in close combat, the dispassionate Throwers are some of the few Lost to actually use long-distance weaponry, and use throwing axes to some efficiency. What they lack in precision they make up for in sheer force, and their thrown axes are known to bite sharp and go deep. Throwers often are part of the first wave of an attacking army of the Lost, but are also encountered in other fighting forces. Yet it is quite rare to encounter parties of Throwers on their own, and it seems that without the driving force of their brethrens' ferocity, they lack or forget any goal they might have had. They march and fight until complete and fatal exhaustion, ignoring their wounds and never leaving the battlefield, even if a combat had raged for hours or days on end. Where other Lost continue hitting a defeated foe in their frenzy, the thrower might do the same thing for the only reason that no one has told them to stop.  Also, it has occurred that without leadership or examples to follow, they stayed so intent on a given order that they completely ignored enemies whilst marching to a destination point even under heavy crossbow fire. While being one of the less dangerous of the Lost, the Thrower is by no means to be underestimated.",

        "description": "The Magma Crawler is probably an artificially bred life form. Its sheer mindless aggressiveness compared to the obvious strategic deployment of the Magma Crawler can lead to no other conclusion than that it is a biological weapon which is very difficult to control. It can safely be assumed that it originated in the breeding pens of what the gnomes call 'those below'.If this is the case, it is bred for war and destruction. It is probably deployed to do maximum damage in underground environments. After a Magma Crawler has been set loose, it is usually abandoned. This explains why wandering specimens can be found almost anywhere underground, usually at the end of a path of destruction. As only male Magma Crawlers have been found, it is assumed that the female creatures are retained for breeding purposes, and to prevent the race from spreading excessively. Given the longevity of the Magma Crawlers, this precautionary measure is not overly effective. Some captured specimens survived for dozens of years without showing significant signs of aging. Considering the threat even a single Magma Crawler poses, it is not unusual for a group of them to cause entire cave systems to collapse. It is not yet known if the Magma Crawlers somehow manage to escape the havoc they wreak or if they perish in it.",

When only a few Mammoths were still alive, the great north wind Chyll looked into this matter and decided to intervene.

They learned to defend themselves from the greed of man. Still, the Mammoths never again became as numerous as they had been in the past.

Nonetheless they are intelligent, if not as much as their benign sphinx sisters or gracious lamassu brothers. They have an ancient and lasting rivalry with the gryphons for reasons that are unknown to most mortals. Sages of Kilmaresh are researching this question for centuries but by now every story is just mere speculation. The best theory is that the manticores, favourite Anuma of the sun goddess Fafnar, hate the gryphons as they are Suon's favourite children. When Suon cast his wild sister out, the manticores accepted his sentence as all Anuma did, but bear a grudge against the gryphons ever since.\n \nManticores roam the vast steppes of Kilmaresh, hunting for prey and defending their territories. Interestingly, they are able to interbreed with common lions. The progeny of such a mating is a special kind of very strong lions with poisonous fangs but they are rarely encountered.",

Their mating is a brutal fight in which the winner injects his genetic material into the looser, which physically, though temporally transforms said creature in being able to gestate an offspring. Births are also rather brutal and bloody too and often leaves the dying 'mother' as the first meal of its offspring. If the 'mother' survives the birth though, chances are that it in turn feeds on the offspring. Given such a reproduction it rather wonders how such a creature couldn't have died out already but perhaps it hardened the survivors that much, that they stand a better chance in such an hostile environment. \nEven in a vicious and brutal land like Gnomprona, the Mantosaurus raises the bar of viciousness and brutality quite a bit. Their attacks and eating habits are wild and bloody. \nThis creature leaves little to subtlety by rather attacks head on, seemingly eager to burrow its claws and mandibles into flesh and rip it apart. \nThe only thing that keeps them from tearing apart even each other, is the presence of a local alpha Mantosaurus. \nUsually the most ferocious of the bunch it maintains its status by shredding any competitor into pieces. Now and then it's challenged by another Mantosaurus for its position. It is yet unknown what entices one of the creatures to try their luck in such a fight but it occurs occasionally. For the loser it means certain death, the winner holds a special position of respect amongst its brutal peers. An alpha Mantosaurus is the first to feast and every other Mantosaurus meekly abandons its prey if an alpha shows up. The alphas usually stop any infights of Mantosauri they become aware of, possibly to prevent any competitor to arise from such infights. \nIf an alpha is killed by other predators Mantosauri fight over its corpse as any competitor that eats most of said corpse becomes the next alpha. If no corpse is available it leads to a massacre amongst the Mantosauri and the local alpha that arises is often left with little to rule over or might die soon on his grievous wounds.",

        "description": "Mindless souls, bound together by the hostile environment of Zarganash, this pitiful horrors roam the realm to spread their suffering and misery. They are drawn to even the most flimsy glimmer of hope and bravery and will do everything to destroy it. Living travellers in Zarganash are like a blazing beacon to them and they won't stop until this beacon is extinguished once and for all. They will use everything at their disposal to annihilate their target and follow it relentlessly. Yet if the target becomes maddened by despair they immediately cease their attacks, seemingly oblivious to even the existence of their former victim. Rather than being an individual, the many faces seem to be a conglomerate of souls that were fused together by an unknown force. An event that seemingly randomly affects denizens of Zarganash, so that the many faces can actually consist of a diverse cast of other denizen of the realm. Even the number of fused souls varies greatly but it seems to need a certain amount of accumulated power until a many faces is formed. So a few powerful souls might be sufficient to form such a creature, whereas it would take a great number of lesser souls to form another. Most many faces consist of two or three more powerful souls that battle for dominance while the weaker souls they consist of to, have no influence over the amalgam creature at all. They seem to be dominated by the most potent soul that they consist of. Though in constant battle with other personas the dominant spirit maintains complete control over his conglomerate body. This control is broken though when the many faces are sufficiently damaged and their behaviour turns to rather erratic and random patterns. Eons ago the many faces served the dread maiden as her harbingers, until an unknown event caused a schism. In our days the many faces flee the presence of the dread maiden and are hunted by their other minions. The maiden herself though, is said to pay the many faces no attention at all.   ",

        "description": "Venorean authorities put a lot of effort into suppressing the voices who claim the Marsh Stalker is a product of magically enforced breeding projects of some trade barons. Even if the Marsh Stalkers were bred on purpose, it is hard to tell now what the original intention behind this project might have been. The Marsh Stalker is very territorial, breeds in great numbers, and has become a bothersome nuisance in the areas where it can be found. Its worst habit is caused by its diet, which consists not only of plants and insects, but also of plant fluids and most notably tree sap, which it obtains by pecking open the bark with its strong beak. As a rule, the trees don't suffer such a treatment and are irreversibly damaged or killed. This poses a threat to all settlements which rely on wood, as Marsh Stalkers are known to ruin the woods of certain areas quite rapidly if unchecked. What is more, the Marsh Stalker is unable to tell a living plant from a wooden construction, and frequently ruins not only the wood supply, but also wooden objects in general. Even worse, the Marsh Stalker considers everything that lives a rival and tries to chase it away using its strong beak and sharp claws. As it is unable to realise that its intimidation tactics do not work, this may lead to a gruesome fight to the bitter end. \nStill, some people fancy the feathers of the Marsh Stalker as material for tailoring, and Marsh Stalker steak is considered a delicacy in certain areas. Ironically, almost exclusively in areas where the Marsh Stalker is not known as a safety hazard, and quite rare. Some underground arenas raise Marsh Stalkers for cage fights, but raising them is a complicated process that takes a lot of time and effort, and so such fights are very rare. Attempts to train the aggressive birds in some way have not met with any notable success yet. Constant hunts and campaigns have limited the appearance of the Marsh Stalker to rather remote areas, although the beast seems relatively adaptable.",

Even though reports of the destruction of whole settlements by Massive Earth Elementals suggests that these elementals aim for bigger targets than their smaller kin, it has recently been discovered that attacks on artificial structures by earth elementals happen just as often as by massive ones. Their fame as town destroyers only arose from  their strength which allows them to be much more successful than its smaller version.\nIt is unknown why earth elementals rise in different sizes.

        "description": "Compared to normal elementals, the massive fire elementals are not only a mere concentration of the elemental fire, but also of fear and primal anger. It is their nature to destroy, to kill and to devour. Though intelligent, it is rarely known of such an elemental to control their anger long enough to be reasoned with. Even though they are not truly allied with the demonic forces, their desire to fight and to destroy more often than not has put them into uneasy alliances of destruction. Sometimes demonic overlords even manage to cull the massive fire elementals into servitude. It is said that some truly powerful magicians also managed this feat. There are also ancient rumours of something that the massive fire elementals desire above anything else; a desire in them burning so hot that it even pales their hatred. With this as bargaining tool, in the past some creatures managed to enlist the help of these elementals. Others knew long-lost spells to bind the elemental forces to their will. Thus vast armies of fire elementals, lesser and great, marched in the battles of the god wars. Several places in the known world still bear the mark of their doing, even after all these centuries. For now, the threat of another such attack seems unlikely and no greater numbers of massive fire elementals in our world have yet been encountered. Gnomish intelligence reports, however, speak of fire elementals of all kinds in the service of the enigmatic rulers 'below'. If they are servants, allies or only attracted by the mayhem and heat attributed to the activities of 'those below', is up to speculation. All evidence suggests though that there are far more of them left in the world than was assumed for a long time.",

        "description": "Mean lost souls managed to retain a certain level of consciousness. Instead of coming to terms with the reasons they got lost, they embrace their conflicts and hatred. They are driven by malicious intents and roam the nether realms almost in a predatory way. Some of them manage to evolve into more malicious forms after a long time of existence. This is often encouraged by a dark mentor that already acquired such a state. Such mentors tend to gather a cultish following of mean lost souls that serve as their minions and army. Others band together in loose-knit groups of mutual benefit. Though relatively rare, their conscious efforts or assignments lead them into the more populated areas of the netherworlds that raise the chance to encounter them significantly. They often relish into inciting other kinds of lost souls to join them in their attacks by means unknown to modern researchers. The malicious component of the mean lost souls seem to be a vital and driving factor in their existence. If in some way pacified, the mean lost souls revert to an instinctive state of mind out of which they sometimes cant switch back. Mean lost sous seem strongly attracted to the world of the living and often try to cross the barriers. By their nature such travel seems impossible but the weakening of the veils between worlds in recent times could make such a breach entirely possible. What might happen to mean souls that manage to pass through is yet up to speculation with haunting manifestations seen as the most likely outcome. Other more disturbing theories assume that a mean spirit in our world would be able to feed on life and soul alike and become some form of revenant with yet in-gaugeable power. In the nether realms their presence seems to cause some kind of pollution. Their aggressive mean spiritedness seeps outwards and changes the malleable essence of the nether realm in twisted ways. Over time their continued presence has created foul lairs of evil, pockets of despair and corruption in which their nature seems to thrive. Such lairs often catch the attention of other beings of evil wandering the underworld. Sometimes they just join the lost souls that reside at such places, in other cases they outright kill or drive away the former inhabitants and take over. Some of the dark mentors are even rumored to have used the mean lost souls to created their own twisted kingdoms of evil in remote pockets of the realms of the dead.",

This aspect of these stories does in fact reflect reality.\nRecent research conducted with the help of daring adventurers has shed a great deal of light upon the origin of Medusae. It has been discovered that they are in fact elemental creatures of earth. They are, or, more accurately, were spirits of nature and earth, probably closely related to dryads. Such spirits are known to be bound to specific places. Their appearance and nature is a reflection of the place they are bound to. While this is their strength it is also their vulnerability, as, if their home should become corrupted, the nature of the spirits bound to it becomes corrupted also. This is often a traumatic event for the unfortunate spirit, and if it does not result in the spirit's death, it is likely to drive it to madness. In the process of this change, the spirit is torn free of its link to its homeland, and is released to roam the land, spreading chaos and destruction in its wake. A tragic fate with tragic consequences.\n\nThe myth of the Medusa's hideousness is greatly exaggerated - in fact it is the corruption and madness that ravages the former beauty of these creatures that creates the impression of ugliness. It is certainly not the mere sight of these beings that turns living beings into stone. Medusae are capable of petrifying their victims because they are magical beings, imbued with elemental powers which are a remnant from their previous lives, now sadly corrupted like the rest of their being. Driven by their madness and an unbearable sense of loss, they cannot bear to see beauty and attempt to destroy and corrupt what was once sacred to them to alleviate the pain they are suffering. This mentality makes them the natural consorts of demons and all things evil.\nSometimes demons purposely desecrate holy sites of nature to force the creation of Medusae but that process more often then not just leads to the demise of the earth spirits. Medusae themselves are much more proficient in corrupting such places while corrupting the bound spirit as well in the process. So sometimes small covens of Medusae are formed and some of them have even managed to carve themselves a niche in the demonic hierarchy.",

These colossal and conceited creatures, adorned with three heads, are constantly engaged in fierce battles for supremacy. Their internecine struggles are exacerbated by their shared belief that they are the epitome of excellence. It doesn't help they were taught to be the best of the best as each head tends to see those words as addressed to himself only. Rarely do the heads find accord, but when they do, the Mega Dragon ascends rapidly in power. Whenever one of their kind becomes overly influential, it is prone to draw the attention of Nimmersatt. In theory such dragons should be all what Nimmersatt envisioned then to be. However, this often triggers his vanity, leading to the unfortunate fate of the influential dragons being invited to his dinner table - as lunch. Nimmersatt's casual disregard for the potential consequences of his actions may prove detrimental to his ambitions of dragon dominance, but in his eyes, Nimmersatt is always right. ",

Albeit aside from the shape of its silhouette similarities quickly end. \nThe reflective skin of the Mercurial Menace does not only provide an ample physical protection, but it also shrouds the fast moving flyer with a shroud of irritating light reflections that can confuse opponents and let many attacks only hit thin air. Yet this additional protection comes with added weight that makes airborne manoeuvres vastly more difficult and the Mercurial Menace quickly becomes hard pressed to maintain greater heights even if needed. \nThere seems to be a yet to be discovered island at some remote spot in the gnomerean seas, where they return to breed and raise their young. This somewhat seem to restrict them to certain areas of Gnomprona and stop them from spreading too far. As the Mercurial Menaces seems to spend only little time there at all such a place is probably some inhospitable yet safe piece of rock. \nTheir seemingly erratic movement and attack patterns add to the confusion, which is one of the most dangerous tools of this flying predator. It moves swiftly, attacks, retreats a little only to attack again in the next moment. Added with the slightly blinding effects of their skin, the Mercurial Menace seems to shift places within a blink. \nTheir constant chirping that rather reminds one of crickets than any bird, mammal or lizard, adds to the confusion that they spread. Another sound they employ is closely resembling those of the local shrieking crystals, which might be some form of acoustic mimicry that adds to their tools of distraction and confusion. It's of note that this chirping or acoustic mimicry only starts when the Mercurial Menace is already attacking and it can approach its target with almost any noise, trying to attack by surprise. \nDespite being skilled, though not enduring flyers they tend to roam close to the grounds and rather fly through thickets then to fly over it. That might be to avoid the arial superiority of the numerous nighthunters that roam the upper layers of gnompronean airspace.",

Sadly, these attempts are often lethal for mortals, and so it is strongly advised to fight back with all means.\nIts ability to produce a copy of itself might be another attempt to interact with our world.

        "description": "The metal gargoyles are a common sight in the city of Rathleton. Visitors are rarely aware though that they serve another purpose then pure decoration. In fact, the gargoyles are wards and vessels for the various spirits that plague the whole isle. The first gargoyles were build as mere wards, covered with barely visible engravings of protective runes. They were placed all over the city and did at least ease the pressure of disturbing spirits a bit. Still exorcists were needed to drive out spirits from homes, places and people. Those brave people faced the problem that even exorcised spirits tended to reappear quite soon and they had to look for a more permanent solution. They needed a vessel to keep the spirits captured and bound. The gargoyles, already prepared to repel spiritual power became their first choice. Newly constructed gargoyles were no longer placed in the city immediately but stored until needed by exorcists. Then the exorcist would bind the spirit into the gargoyle, where it would be trapped by the wards. When an exorcist decided a gargoyle had reached it keeping potential, the gargoyle was finally placed at its final resting place. This procedure though was not without risks and the capacity of a gargoyle was as hard to determine as the strength of a particular spirit. This led to strange occurrences in which the gargoyles came to an entirely unnatural form of life. Whenever a gargoyle came to life it happened suddenly. It seemed that some outer influence triggered a fusing of the spirits to a new entity that would take over the gargoyles overcharged body. Those creatures are driven purely by instinct. Although not entirely evil and not actively hunting for some sort of prey they instinctively attack certain types of creatures, with humans especially enticing this aggression. Metal gargoyles are quiet strong and due to their spiritual heritage possess certain powers that resemble magic. They usually fight without finesse or greater tactic but their strength and mindless determination make more than up for that. In recent time unscrupulous entrepreneurs have sold huge shiploads of metal gargoyles that were considered already unsafely unstable as decoration objects all over the world. It is yet to see if their spiritual energy can fuse them into semi living beings outside the Rathleton area. ",

Only a daring expedition of the Explorer Society that tried to uncover the myth of the Midnight Panther brought home proof of its existence. Many members of the expedition paid this discovery with their lives. As living myth, the Midnight Panther is attributed with many magic abilities and skills. Given the short and violent confrontation of the expedition with a Midnight Panther, none of those claims could be verified.

Ralda, a wandering priestess took it upon her to renew their faith and change it through new doctrines. The peaceful and rather passive role switched gradually into a more protective and active one. The combat training became more emphasized and the amazons began to accompany their people into battles. This change gained more and more in momentum by it success and was at last adapted even by societies that never had come into contact with Raldo themselves. With this change what in the past had been an informal group of like minded people, became also a more and more formalized order. To become an amazon a minotauress had to be mother of at least four calves. Though they server the ties to their former families they renew them by becoming the mothers of all their people, sworn to treat and protect their nation like they did for their own former families. The amazons, though skilled fighters are also the caretakers and healers for their brethren and sisters. They are well educated and schooled not only in battle but also in tactics, logistics and several other topics important for the survival of their society. Most of them are skilled moohsicians, which is the title of the most skilful singers of the society and arguments between amazons are often settled in singing contests. Amazons are loyal for their nation first and their race second. They fight side by side with their nation even against other minotaur societies. ",

        "description": "The minotaur hunters are not committed to hunt for food but rather to act as scouts and eliminate dangers for the minotaur society. Expert trackers and big game hunters they shun other distance weapons then the spear. They are equally skilled in throwing their spears as in wielding them in battle and as they are trained in some minotaur form of paladin knowledge they are able to conjure them on their own in time of need. A hunter's training begins early in life and requires a certain dedication as the tests of skill and endurance are increasingly challenging from year to year. Each year a number of candidates is rejected and sent to other duties often to the army where their skills are welcome. So many minotaur soldiers possess some grade of schooling in outdoorsmanship. Those who pass all tests are welcomed into the local hunters' lodges. As other societies in minotaur civilization, the hunters are rather secretive about the rituals and secret knowledge of their lodges so little is known beyond the obvious. Only fully accepted hunters are taught the last secrets of the lodges, as certainly several spells to hone their skills. They are also schooled in the anatomy of different species to inflict maximum damage by exploiting weak spots. This is especially handy when fighting larger creatures that are usually only engaged by groups of hunters. Such groups are formed permanently and each hunter belongs to one. The number of members usually differs from five to fifteen with a group size of eight being the standard. A group with fewer than five members is disbanded and the remaining hunters are split between other groups. Still hunters are also sent on solo missions, especially when working for the army. They are the scouts, lookouts and responsible for the choice of camp-sites of a marching army. In Battle they are usually hold back as most minotaur generals yet lack to see their usefulness in open battles. Employed as a group in tandem with an army they are used to harass the enemy, spy on it's move and sabotage their resources. The minotaur hunters really shine though, when it comes to hunt great beasts of the deep such as dragons and behemoths. That is where their training kicks in most and provides groups of hunters with the knowledge and momentum to overcome seemingly overpowered foes. \nThough formerly seen rarely in combat with other the beasts, some smaller and newer minotaur communities rely less and less on a formalized army and according battle tactics. Their troops see a greater number of hunters employed on the battlefield with their combat style working more then well with the skirmish approach that such communities usually employ. ",

        "description": "The mirror images are beyond any classification yet. They don't register to divination magic at all and defy any mundane attempts to examine them more closely. A calculated malice seems to guide them all and their evil intentions are too obvious to be dismissed as random actions. Their malleable forms are elusive and unstable, so guided by their inherent evil, they choose another form to confront their victims. Legends of Zarganash tell about a time when the mirror images walked the realm like gods and took the shape of whatever their intended victims most desired or feared most. At some point in the distant past, however, something happened. Be it a shift in the flows of power, the intervention of one of Zarganash's most powerful denizens or something else completely, no one can tell. Whatever the cause has been, the powers of the mirror images were greatly diminished. Still cruel and dangerous they were only a mere shadow of their glorious past and their shifting powers only included a far lesser array of horrible shapes. Some obscure texts seem to claim that the mirrored images can be summoned through blasphemous rituals, even into the mortal realm. Such rituals should be able to force the image into certain forms of manifestation, chosen by the summoner. Such claims are lacking verification yet and the fact that other denizen of Zarganash are bound to the realm in their core it seems somewhat unlikely that such rituals exist or could be easily and reliably performed at all. In Zarganash itself the mirror image it's power level is nowhere as near to the legends of their past. Still they are dangerous opponents that use their shape changing powers to at least some extent to gain an advantage. It is said that no one ever saw the true form of a mirror image and even that they are somehow locked out of their true form since their downfall. While mirror images have perished their overall number seems not to be affected by this. This leads to the assumption that for all their enigmatic qualities they are somehow also bound to the damning circle of destruction and recreation that has many denizens of Zarganash in its grip. ",

        "description": "The mooh'tah warriors are elite soldiers that dedicated their life to the philosophical teachings of this ancient minotaur philosophy. While each minotaurs is taught the basic principles of the mooh'tah only a few chosen are able to follow its teachings truly. They basic principles are meant to help the minotaurs to ease their inner rage, which is considered as unclean and offensive. The ultimate goal is to not only master the inner anger but dissolve it into spiritual energy. The ultimate idea is instead of dedicating energy to fight the anger, in the end the anger becomes additional energy and therefore supply of enormous power. Since the true path of mooh'tah requires not only dedication but also time and resources, it's usually the nobility that can afford to indulge the studies. While the first lessons are basic and primary consists of philosophic teachings, soon also the body is honed. Beginning with breathing techniques and continuing with the correct way to move, the training becomes over the years more and more martial. As the first lessons teach the spirit and the body to become one, the higher teachings concern the flow of magic and making a weapon a part of their body. The great goal is the unity with the world. This goal is never truly accomplished though and only a few mooh'tah masters are even attempting the impossible and instead concentrate more on their martial progress. This self centred usage of the mooh'tah is considered sinful and false by a few purists. Those usually live as hermits away from minotaur society that they see as rotten and misguided. Still they are often sought out by students that ask for guidance but more often then not those are brusquely turned away. Though their disapproval of minotaur society is well known the hermits are held in high regard by the populace. \nThe more worldly mooh'tah masters are usually part of the local military hierarchy and sometimes form highly valued elite squads within an army. Extremely efficient and unyielding fighters they serve as inspiration for the common troops and sometimes one mooh'tah master alone is enough to turn the tides of battle. Skilled in the art of war and in possession of secret magic they are the epitome of all that a minotaur could want to be. Towards non minotaurs that are obviously not even aware of the principle of mooh'tah they usually only feel disgust, but it would be of course beneath a true master to show that. ",

        "description": "Minotaurs are born with a great inner rage that constantly threatens to drive them over the edge and turn them into berserkers that know no friend or foe, all the less concern for their own health or even some form of strategy. This state of mind is considered unclean by the minotaurs and their society had come up with several ways to cope with this problem. Yet no minotaur would foolishly deny that this inner rage is a constant companion in a minotaurs life. Sometimes this rage manifests in especially cruel ways. Some tragic minotaurs are born 'into the rage' as the minotaurs say. They never have a chance to battle their inner rage but are born into the world with fierce anger and bloodlust. Those young calves are taken into custody by special trainers, most of the high ranking mooh'tah masters. They train the youngsters to at least control somewhat of their rage and funnel it into certain tiresome and draining tasks. This upbringing with mining, hauling and woodcutting from the earliest age combined with the constant burning energy in them, lets them grow out of the proportions of normal minotaurs. Often easily twice as high as a minotaur this veritable giants are more beast then civilized minotaur. Regardless of the strictness of their upbringing they never grasp concepts of society. They never develop the ability of speech and only communicate through moohing sound to express simple emotions. Yet they understand simple commands and therefore are used as powerful work-machines and dangerous weapons in combat. Despite their strength and arguably usefulness they are shunned and despised by minotaur society. They are the lowest of the low and mistrusted. Oddly enough their handlers and trainers are usually regarded with admiration, because they take it upon them to handle the unclean so that the rest of the society can ignore their existence. Hardly more intelligent then a dog and only able to use the most simple tools and weapons the moohtants, as they are called by humans, are rarely deployed in battle unless times are very desperate. While the rulers of civilized places like Mintwalin tend to tow them away out of sight and use them in remote mines, younger communities can't afford such luxury and use their power with often dangerous frequency.

        "description": "Zarganash's hostile environment gave birth to an own breed of phantoms that differ by the hazards that help to form them from the tormented souls they once were. Spirits, soaked with decay and putrefaction, the mould phantoms are the heralds of rot. Wither is what they breathe, decay what accompanies them. They lack any true sentience, though their processing of captured souls through a disgusting version of composting, they sometimes appear to interact with their environment on purpose. This is yet only a random illusion though. The true self of the mould phantom is of a wandering zone of decay. More a natural disaster than an entity. There is some interaction between mould phantoms but this seems to follow more natural laws, shared amongst their kind and not by sentient decisions. Other such interactions are their attraction to living things. Their nature draws them to the living to spread their decay to them and share their rot. Even here they don't hurt the living on some kind of purpose but by inherent attributes of their rotten existence. They are drawn to certain places in Zarganash and though the unschooled eye see little difference in this places to other, they can be considered as Zarganash centres of decay. As such they seem to change over time, which leads to hordes of mould phantoms that migrate to new centres that they seem to sense over great distances. Such tides of mould phantoms are usually avoided by other denizens of Zarganash. Even more so, since the wandering phantoms display an otherwise unseen amount of unity in these times. If one is attacked, the attacker is quickly swarmed and usually overwhelmed by the horde, that stops its voyage until the enemy is utterly annihilated. When they reach their destination the horde quickly disperses. When a mould phantom has settled it's usually extremely territorial and does not wander off too much. That is until a new horde is formed.   ",

For this reason, bat blood is high-priced among alchemists and probably also explains the bats connection to vampires in some way. Due to certain influences by contaminated food or magical radiation, some bats transformed into horrible beasts. These beasts are well-known as Mutated Bats. Unlike intended mutations that origin from experiments, the mutation of bats seem to happen rather spontaneous.\nMutated Bats seem to lack the fertility of other mutated species as it is was never heard that they brought up offspring. The transformation into a giant-sized mutated bat seems to put some strain on the bats, turning them incredibly aggressive. Only the company of other Mutated Bats seems to calm them a little. Lonely Mutated Bats can become so aggressive that they attack their own shadow until they die of exhaustion.\nIn certain areas with a high magical contamination, the Mutated Bat has become a dangerous plague. Swarms of those bats have killed whole small villages in a single night. Moving only in the darkness, they devastate the land like a swarm of locusts until they are stopped by military or brave heroes.\nAs it is rather easy to create Mutated Bats on purpose, scholars of magic or alchemy often use them as watchdogs or tools of vengeance. Their aggressive and destructive nature makes such  endeavours dangerous at best, and not few lost control of their vicious pet in a rather inconvenient moment.",

Their blurred minds rarely allow them planned actions. Their mutations were caused by contaminated material or magical radiation. In most cases, this has led to more or less slow and painful deaths, but in some cases the subjects managed to survive. If they retained some degree of sentience, they would rather wish to be dead, though. Due to the mutation, hardly anything of the original physiology is still intact, and sometime during the mutation process, the mind collapses in an act of self-defence. Having endured unimaginable conditions, the mutated bodies are highly resilient and extremely strong. Packs of Mutated Humans can easily dismantle whole neighbourhoods within a single night.\nDriven by animal-like instincts, the mutants often form packs in which the alpha mutant leads his brethren on hunts and raids. Mutated Humans usually hunt for food rather than for plunder.

Given the rats' ferocious appetite and the thoughtless disposal of residues by alchemists, Mutated Rats are not as uncommon as one might like. They are subject of many rumours and legends as they are hardly met during daytime. This makes it somewhat hard to give an adequate description of their attitudes and abilities. It is certain that their behaviour usually does not change much due to the mutation other than becoming more daring. Rumour has it that depending on their sources of food - the disgusting details will be left out here - they might get frightening intelligent and live much longer than usual rats. Mutated Rats always take the leadership over the common rats in their area. Being the leader, the Mutated Rats rarely leave the deepest lairs but are served and fed by their smaller brethren. In combat they are rarely seen without the company of ordinary rats that seem to serve as their soldiers. They are definitely more powerful and even vital than their smaller kin but they are still not much of a threat for an experienced fighter.\nIt is also said that some of them actually become immortal and gain magic knowledge from devouring whole books about magic. Those Mutated Rats are actually able to learn certain rat related spells and become powerful ratomancers. However, those are just rumours and there have never been any real facts or credible reports.",

In most cases, the mutation is rather a by-product of another process that aims at stealing the cat's vitality and agility to produce a youth potion that is of great demand among the wealthy and powerful all over the world. Although some of the most resilient tigers survive this horrible draining-process, they  turn incurably mad and wild. In addition, these rare individuals become much more vital and stronger than they have ever been in their former lives.\nTo the dismay of some excited alchemists, who had tried to drain those beasts to gain even more powerful potions, the vital force of Mutated Tigers is toxic. This, however, did not stop the alchemists to undertake further gruesome experiments. After surviving these cruel experiments, the beasts reached a point beyond madness and rage. They are the incarnation of pain and agony, and seem to want to spread them both as much as possible. With their increased power, it becomes more and more difficult to have them in their laboratories.\nSometimes, thoughtless alchemists release the beasts into the wild, when it becomes too dangerous to keep them. Others are sold to arenas, zoos or curiosity shows. The buyer usually regrets the trade quickly - that is, if he is lucky to live long enough to regret something.\nUnlike to their former lives, Mutated Tigers care little for stealth and lying in ambush. They usually charge an opponent and try to overwhelm him with sheer ferocity and power. They seem  to need immense amounts of food after their mutation, still if they have the chance, they kill much more than they could possible need for survival.",

The most common occurrence is the common bat, though they tend to stay in the upper layers of the mist for some reason. There they feast on the many flying insects that inhabit the mist but in turn become the major prey to the nighthunters. The name nighthunter seems inappropriate in an area that is shrouded in a constant gloom by blowing mists and clouds. Yet for some odd reason the nighthunters prefer to strike when the local mists occasionally darken, even if only slightly. Then their level of activity rises dramatically. This might hint at a day and night cycle that might have existed in Gnomprona in a distant past, yet that leaves to wonder how and why such a thing should have existed. Another theory suggests, that a lack of light mitigated some of the irritation powers of the mercurial menaces, the nighthunters prime competitors in the skies. \nSome Gnomish sages theorise that in the distant past a now extinct progenitor race, related to the Naga, at one point fled from the ground, where it was accustomed to day and night cycles, into the bowels of earth where they used their magic to recreate some patterns that resembles those known from their former home. This would put other theories that much of the above ground life originated in Gnomprona upside down of course. \nUnlike the other airborne threat of Gnomprona, the mercurial menace, they usually prefer to hunt in the upper layers of the mist. Given the sheer number of bats, they find enough prey to rarely leave this habitat. They breed in nests at the mountainous cliffs of the volcano and their sheer numbers are frighteningly high. \nThe nighthunters encountered on ground are only a small fraction of the real population. They are the older nighthunters that became too big and lost much of their original agility. \nAs they became unable to compete with their younger siblings in the skies they had to try their luck in hunts way closer to ground level. There they join the plethora of other predators yet seemingly still have a higher chance of survival. The one thing that improved with their age, however, is the toxify of their spittle. While the younger Nighthunters spit is a mere nuisance lover the years it becomes more and more poisonous and harmful, providing the older nighthunters on the ground leave a formidable weapon to hunt their prey or fed of competitors.

        "description": "It is highly unlikely that the so-called Nightmare Scion is actually the offspring of a nightmare. Some people say that the Nightmare Scions are a completely different breed than the nightmares, others claim that they are the same breed, only weaker due to injuries or some sort of demonic disease. A common theory states that the Nightmare Scions are the prototype of the actual nightmare. Just like this theory, also another one assumes that nightmares do not breed, but that all nightmares come into existence through the same process. Those creatures that do not possess  the full amount of power turn into Nightmare Scions. It is not known, yet if Nightmare Scions can become true nightmares by ageing or maybe by accumulating power in some way. They are usually found in the company of nightmares and seem to get along with each other quite well for demonic races.\nWhat a Nightmare Scion lacks in raw power, it tries to make up with wickedness. They are exceptionally cruel and love to prey on weaker foes. In general, they occur in great numbers to be safe. This seems not only to combine their power but also their wickedness. Nightmare Scions love to stalk their victims in the shadow for hours. Making sure they get noticed by their prey, they seem to feed on the fear they arouse. After some while, the Nightmare Scions will begin to slowly attack their victims until the whole force will swarm around the prey. Victims of Nightmare Scions can be easily recognised by the fear frozen into their dead faces.",

Still some demons lurk at the borders of dreams, watching, drooling with hatred and greed. Sometimes a dreamer gets some distant feeling of those unwelcome spectators. Such dreams often turn into nightmares. The chaos and fear, that  is caused by nightmares, allow the lurking demons to steal some of the essence of these dreams. By eating more and more of this substance, demons gain certain characteristics which are normally not at disposal of demons. To some extent they are even able to haunt the dreams of the mortals, although their influence is only indirect and limited.

Like some other demonic creatures, they seem to feed, at least partially, on the fear of their victims. Divination magic revealed that they are no native denizens of our realm, however, the question where Nightstalkers actually come from is still unanswered. They are cunning and intelligent creatures that are even able to talk our language. They prefer lairs in dark and abandoned places like ruins and caves. Sometimes, Nightstalkers form small colonies, but most of them are notorious loners.\nSages speculate that the Nightstalkers' wish for loneliness results from their life cycle. At certain stages in their life, they leave the company of their kin to become lonely prowlers that secretly stalk the settlements of civilised creatures to haunt particularly their children. During these stages, Nightstalkers seem to dematerialise, almost like ghosts. They feed on the fears of those around them and adopt features derived from these subconscious fears. Luckily, Nightstalkers also gain a certain vulnerability in this state. After some while, Nightstalkers gradually retransform to their original state. Once they have reached it, they seem to hibernate for a while, which surely explains why they  tend to leave civilised places in advance of the transformation. Thereafter, they live for a longer period in their natural state in which they might be encountered at remote places. During this phase, they do not actively prey on creatures but are more than ready to rip anyone in pieces who gets close to their lairs.",

Among with the already impressive Roaring Lions the majestic and powerful Noble Lions dwell in caves and ruins rather than in the desert.They are the biggest and strongest type of lions, also varying in appearance and behavior. Their fur has a golden shimmer and their eyes remind of radiant emeralds. Also they act in a more intelligent way when preying and therefore are more dangerous than the customary lion. Some sages think the Noble Lions are a sort of mystical beings from olden times because they are so often found in the ruins of ancient sanctuaries or buried temples. Whether they are the wardens of these sacred sites or were themselves a subject of worship is a secret that has still to be revealed. As far as is known they sometimes allow particularly worthy heroes to ride them into battle. ",

        "description": "The Noxious Ripptor is a prime example for the gnompronean fauna. A primal beast and probably the ancestor of at least one surface creature and its subspecies. It's a feral predator whose aggressiveness supersedes that of all of its descendants. The Ripptors are known to attack everything that moves, even if just fed or even feeding. They seem to forget anything else as soon as a new target for their aggression shows up. This aggressive behaviour is seemingly randomly extended to members of their own species from time to time. Sudden attacks and fight between two or more Noxious Ripptors are quite common and differently to other such occurrences in the animal kingdom, might lead to the death or dismembering of the fighting creatures. In battle they show little regard to their own safety and no Noxious Ripptor will ever retreat from a fight once it begun. Only another distraction may draw a Ripptor from its current prey. \nThe noxious part of their name comes from their disgusting ability to vomit balls of toxic residue that they can seemingly produce in abundance. They use it to shower their victims from afar while closing in as they obviously just want to ultimately rip and tear whatever they might attack.\nCuriously enough they seem to be drawn to the sound admitted by the so called Shrieking Cry-stals though it seemingly puts them into a kind of milder form of their common frenzy. So it's not uncommon for them to follow said creatures and the latter, also prone to aggressive attacks of their own, seem not to mind at all. \nGnomish attempts to in turn influence Ripptors with their own resonating crystals lead to no reaction of the Ripptors at all. Further experiments revealed that the Ripptors are almost deaf and completely rely on sense like smell and sight for orientation. The next logical step, to widen the research on crystal vibrations have yet not lead to anything fruitful.",

They have a plump, corpulent body, chunky hands and feet and a small, seemingly neckless head. An average adult ogre stands over twelve feet tall, and his waist circumference is almost the half of his height. Most ogres are bald and only rarely have facial hair. They use wooden clubs as weapons, banded, studded or spiked with iron; but stone hatchets or fork-like weapons are also common. While missile combat with bows or crossbows is too difficult for them, they are good at throwing heavy things, particularly boulders. They mature more quickly than humans, reaching adulthood at the age of twelve.\n\nOgres live in tribes that inhabit the steppe and grassland of Krailos, for the most part dwelling in big leather tents or stone huts, though some ogre tribes still have nomadic tendencies. Leader of a tribe is usually the strongest male ogre. The chieftain is supported by an ogre-shaman. If the shaman is female, the two are often, but not necessarily, a couple. The chieftain is responsible for all decisions concerning the hunt and martial matters while the shaman is responsible for all affairs spiritual and social. \n\nAlthough the ogres are a warlike, often brutal people, they are mostly interested in good food rather than in anything else. Ogres worship the Great Hunger, a kind of spirit being they believe will eat up the entire world if not fed regularly. Therefore they often perform rites of sacrifice (of food and of living creatures) to feed this entity.\n\nMost male ogres come in two varieties, brutes and savages. Their main task is to fight for the clan or to scout the steppe for something edible. Ogre brutes specialise in hurling boulders and brute force, punching and crushing their enemy with their enormous body weight. Sometimes, however, they may also carry a single large club or heavy axe for emphasis.",

Ogre savages favour fang-like weapons, like short swords made of stone, axes of crude iron or clubs carved out of animal horn. No less dangerous than the brutes, most ogre savages prefer weapons with an edge or blade over a club - the better to slice their enemy's belly or to bleed and weaken their fleeing prey.

        "description": "The Omnivora is a strange offshoot of the Carniphila plant. This strain had an especially short life cycle, which allowed it to react rapidly to changes due to the fast production of new generations. It is assumed that some of those Carniphilas adapted to a more mountainous terrain, and settled in deep and dark valleys. Finding less soil and relying more on their carnivorous nature, they slowly compensated the lack of minerals through an enhanced digestion system which allowed them to consume bones and stones that the ordinary Carniphila would leave over. Less dependent on sunlight, the ancestors of the Omnivora found their way into the eternal darkness of subterranean areas. This they found to be a new habitat they were ideally suited for. The Omnivora quickly spread via tunnels and underground streams which carried their seeds. Only the fierce predators of the underground, who found the Omnivora a delicacy, stopped the population from exploding. Over time, the Omnivora adapted itself again and became highly toxic and inedible, but also less fertile. This led to a more stable population, but also to the Omnivora becoming the predator instead of the prey. The plants had developed highly acidic fluids to support their digestion of minerals, and newer generations employed these acids as weapons. Additionally, the plant used a surplus of certain minerals to build thorns around its blossom which acted as teeth. This led to a new cannibalistic behaviour, though. While Carniphila seedlings usually grow in immobile patches, the Omnivora, though featuring a similar reproduction pattern, as a seedling soon begins to attack other nearby seedlings; and this is repeated as soon as its growth allows it to reach the next seedling. Such infights usually continue until only one Omnivora seedling is left. \nBeing a plant, it does not too well in too cold or too dry habitats, but apart from that the Omnivora's adaptable nature makes it possible to encounter it almost everywhere. Rather than looking for some additional sunlight like its Carniphila cousin, the Omnivora shuns direct sunlight, and usually settles in underground areas. Since they are particularly fond of the minerals provided by creatures turned into stone, Omnivoras seek out the proximity of creatures like Medusae if possible. The Medusae in turn seem to accept the Omnivora as some kind of decoration or pets in their lairs, unless they feel that the Omnivora is a pest destroying their 'artwork'. \nSome people warn that the development of the Omnivora species is not over yet, and that we might see an even more dangerous and aggressive breed in a few generations.

        "description": "The war in Zao required a high degree of mobility. The answer to this request was the mounted archer. However, it took some time to make this solution palatable to the savage orcs. Barely able to control their blood lust, the orcs easily forgot their intention to stay away from the enemy and steered their mounts into the fray. Those who managed to withstand such urges were often seen as cowards and were widely shunned by other orcs. Only with the coming of their new leaders such prejudices changed. The few scattered Orc Marauders were combined and received additional training. Some of the smarter orcs were picked to support the ranks of the riders and once their effectiveness was proven, the acceptance of the Orc Marauders among the orcs grew continuously.\nUsed more efficiently, these new units of the orcish horde made the difference that was necessary to tune the tones of war at least for a while. The Orc Marauders attacked the lizard armies from afar. Slowly the casualties drained the strength of the lizard armies and the attacks of the orcs became bolder and bolder. The attacks usually started with Orc Marauders weakening the defensive lines. When the main body of the orcs attacked, the Orc Marauders switched to flanking tactics and caught scattered troops on the run. In more peaceful times, Orc Marauders serve as scouts or hunters.\nOnly the most daring orcs are chosen as Orc Marauders. Unlike the warwolves, the gnarlhounds are not bond to a specific orc. Rather the gnarlhounds are shared by the tribe and picked randomly before a raid. Given the unpredictability of the gnarlhounds, it is of little consequence for the rider. Since gnarlhounds are prone to frenzy in battle, the Orc Marauders treat their skin with a mixture of gnarlhound excrements and herbs to avoid being ripped to shreds by their own mounts.",

        "description": "Orclops Doomhaulers are the elite of the orclopses. They make up with cunning what they lack in strength in comparison with the ravager. Before they join a fight, they lead the ravagers from behind, usually using a unique weapon called doomcrusher to weaken the foe from afar.\nOrclops Doomhaulers choose one of their own as leader. The orclops ravagers accept the elected doomhauler's rules without complaint. There is not much to decide in the simple lives of orclopses. For this reason, the main duty of such a leader is to put hunting parties together and to assign them to specific areas. It is also a leader's decision in which direction the tribe will move next. \nOrclops Doomhaulers inherited some of the smithing skills of the cyclopes. This makes them the primary craftsmen of their tribes. They are particularly proud of their personal doomcrushers and they spend a significant amount of time to construct and maintain them. Apart from that they create the few weapons and tools needed by their tribe. However, since orclopses prefer to live a simple life, the doomhaulers' cunning is often seen as a burden rather than a gift.\nOccasionally a doomhauler tries to initiate a trade with local cyclopes, but the latter usually consider orclopses as abominations and react hostilely towards them. Only very rarely, a leader of the doomhaulers manages to form an alliance with cyclopes. Such alliances are shaky at best since even the cyclopes with the best intentions find it hard to ignore the 'orcish degeneration'. Moreover, orclopses have little to offer that the cyclopes could use.\nIt is much more common that an orc tribe is willing to ally with the orclopses. However, the orclopses usually react reservedly to such offers because of their shared past. The orcs, on the other hand, eye the doomhaulers suspiciously. They consider them as a threat to their leadership which is often based on brutality and strength - disciplines in which the Orclops Doomhaulers easily surpass even the strongest orc. \nEven though Orclops Doomhaulers have led orc tribes, it is a relatively uncommon scenario. Still, the rumours about it and the mere possibility prevent alliances between the two on a larger scale. The more powerful an orc warlord, the more he perceives such an alliance as a threat. Like most orclopses, also the majority of the Orclops Doomhaulers actually does not aspire more from their lives than a full stomach. Some of them participate in fierce eating contests with other orclopses but particularly with ogres.\nSome of the Orclops Doomhaulers began to dabble with shamanistic magic.

        "description": "The orclops is a newly discovered breed of orc which, after having been bred extensively by the orcs as war machines, very quickly lost its attraction to the point of extinction. The strength of a cyclops and the brutality of an orc did not mix well. The orclopses were prone to fits of rage and frequent rampages that cost the life of many a tribesman. Although stories of ancient battles mention whole battalions of orclopses, using them was deemed to be too dangerous to be worth the effort. In times of peace, feeding a single orclops was an onerous task for a tribe and feeding half a dozen of them drained a hunting ground empty. As a result, having an orclops became a status symbol for some warlords and all but died out as a subspecies.\nHowever, it can be regarded as ironic that a human secret society brought the orclopses back from the brink of extinction. Although the Brotherhood of Bones specialised in necromancy, some of them were eager to employ different kinds of weapons, minions and allies in their wars against the Nightmare Knights. Allying themselves with the Bloody Tooth orc tribe, they provided the orc shamans with the means to breed a better kind of orclopses. Even though this took time, this led to a new breed of orclopses that were more docile and intelligent, less driven by their basic instincts. Through their new found strength and superior intellect, they began to challenge their orc masters for the leadership of the tribe.  Orc society reacted harshly by simply enslaving the orclopses with brute force. The new orclopses were subjugated and trained for war by their enslavers.\nThis worked well for the orcs for a while. But then came \"Big Ugly\". Big Ugly was an unruly orclops and quite intelligent. To break his spirits, his enslavers made him endure the most torturous procedures of their training again and again. As a result, his body and face were so scarred by wounds that it inspired his name. Big Ugly survived and became the most feared fighter of the orclopses. Due to his strong will, his handlers never dared to use him in wars.  Instead he was forced to compete in brutal pit-fights against captives and monsters from all over the world. Then they made the fateful decision to let him train other orclopses in the arts of fighting. Little did they know how intelligent and persuasive Big Ugly was. In a short time, he became the idol of the orclops slaves of the tribe. He led them in an uprising. He and his allies swept over the tribe in a single night and crushed all resistance.\nFor half a century there was open warfare between orcs and orclopses. Whenever local orcs heard that the orclopses had arrived in their territory, they either slaughtered their orclopses or released them in the hope that this would appease the approaching orclops tribe. Soon only remote tribes still held captive orclopses.\nLuckily for the orcs, the new tribe quickly fell into factions upon the death of Big Ugly. Given their immense need for food, a single territory could not sustain a large tribe for long. The newly created clans roamed the world as nomads, slowly diminishing in numbers once again. Nowadays orclopses and orcs have developed a grudging respect for each other. Some of the smaller clans have even joined orc tribes, although this time as allies instead of as slaves. Others have settled in remote areas independently.\nThe Orclops Ravager is the most common orclops. Strong and somewhat dumb, the typical Orclops Ravager spends most of his day satiating his enormous appetite. In battle he relies on his strength and rarely employs any complicated tactics. ",

        "description": "The Orewalker is a creature of fire and heat. To be more precise, what seems to be the physical body of the Orewalker is just magma, stone and ores, held together by a spirit of heat and fire. The non-corporeal beings create the bodies by sheer force of will, which in turn serve as some kind of anchor in the physical world. If their bodies are destroyed, they are hurled back into the spirit realm from which they originate. It is hard to comment on the Orewalkers' intelligence and intentions, since they seem to be so unfamiliar with the world. Given the fact that they serve in the armies of those below, it is assumed that the Orewalker spirits are called from beyond and more or less forced into a physical body before being unleashed with some rudimentary orders. The spirits are probably highly intelligent, but given the differences between the worlds it seems impossible for any form of communication other than forcing them to do something. It is not known whether they follow those below for their own unfathomable reasons or are reluctant, perhaps even rebellious helpers. Given the treatment of other minions by those below, a form of slavery seems most likely, but an unholy alliance of sorts cannot be ruled out. Any experiments to call and bind such a spirit are futile as long as so little is known about those spirits and their world.\nIn battle, the Orewalkers are somewhat clumsy. Only few of them seem to remain in our world long enough to get some sense of coordination. What they lack in manoeuvrability, they make up for in brutal strength of their snakelike bodies and the heat of the blood-like magma that flows within their veins.",

But the inhabitants of Thais grew deeply annoyed by the flashing lights, and even the claim that the crystals added a unique sight to Thais could not prevent the people demanding their being removed. In the end, the crystal spheres were dismantled and returned to the guild house. Still people complained to the king to do something against the pressing pigeon problem. Yet no bounty nor poison campaigns yielded the result they hoped for. Meanwhile, the people have begun to accuse each other of feeding pigeons, and the term 'pigeon friend' has become a common insult. King Tibianus had several people flogged who had claimed the king might be in league with the pigeons, and things are increasingly getting out of hand. The situation escalated so drastically that priests have even claimed that pigeons might be the eyes of Zathroth, spying on people and sowing hatred into their hearts.",

Couple this with a love for fire and explosions and you get the dangerous mixture of which the pirat bombardiers consist. Whenever there is any task that involves fire, destruction and chaos, the bombardiers are the rats to be sent. And they are not shy to volunteer, as after a string of deadly mishaps before the heydays of pirat-dom, they are not allowed to handle their explosives without permission. So whenever they are ordered to employ their deadly weapons, their whole destructive potential is unleashed with glee. It is said that their favourite diet is the very cheese the green powder mold is growing on and over time the oldest bombardiers become explosive on their own. This myth is yet to be verified since the usual bombardiers behaviour isn't suited for a long live and old age. In fact the life of a bombardier is usually short and fiery. Even without bombs the bombardiers are discernable by burn marks, ashed fur and smouldered whiskers. Even without explosives at hand this pirats have a penchant for everything that burns. The most sane and stable bombardiers are employed as cannoneers and enjoy a certain amount of status amongst the crews. Other bombardiers though look upon them with disdain and have only contempt for this 'tamed fire'. In their spare time many bombardiers become cooks, although the only dish they serve is commonly coal.  \nTo some of them it's the epitome of their destructive existence, to cause as much destruction as possible in their final act and leave the mortal world in a blaze of glory. In the end they really love the smell of green powder in the morning. ",

The sea demands a high death toll amongst the recruits and the crews have to be replenished constantly. Luckily enough for the pirat captains the lure of their promises is strong enough to ensure a steady stream of conscripts so that they simply don't care. Equipped with only the most basic weapons and armour a cutthroat is usually highly depended on his scavenging skills to steal and improvise better equipment, in their desperate battle to survival. A pirats life is cheap and this is employed by their superiors to the fullest. Why waste  expensive green powder on an enemy, that can also be brought down is you only throw enough cutthroats against them. Any halve seasoned pirat is aware of this and tries it's best to raise through the ranks, so it will be them, who sends others to their deaths. While there is a lot backstabbing and treachery amongst those most lowly of pirats, a thing are to be seen is any glimmer of bravery.

Those who survive more than a few seasons on the high seas become battle hardened veterans and are commonly promoted to more responsible positions. A pirate that acquires such a status will never grew bored in letting their ship mates know about it. As battle-hardened veterans of many campaigns they know how to wield their weapons with a certain amount of skill and finesse and how to use their expendable crews to the fullest. In a crew that has to be ambitious to survive, they have to be the most ambitious and resourceful of the bunch and walk over many corpses on their bloody way to the top. This leaves little space to make any friends though short lived alliances in a common goal are not uncommon. Each alliance ends in a foreseeable backstabbing though. As it isn't wise to keep enemies and competitors alive the death toll amongst aspiring mates is particularly high. Yet this unnatural selection leads to especially skilled and shrewd mates in the long run. \nThe mates have little restraint to further their own agendas by sacrificing loads of underlings if this ensures to reach their goals. Their constant bullying enforces the pecking order on their ships and ensures the lower ranks stay in line. As disliked as they are, they become the first line of defence for captains against mutineers but also are prone to certain 'accidents' on board. They are also better equipped and fed then any of the lower ranked crewmates. They use a part of their extra rations to bribe some snitches in the crew to keep them informed about assassination attempts or rumours of mutiny. This tactic has proven surprisingly effective as it's rather hard to smell a rat amongst a Corym crew. Since a mate has proven that he is worth its cheese in numerous battles and survived several attempts on their lives from underlings and competitors for titles, most of them are scared or missing body parts. In the long run every mates aspiration is to get his own ship and become a captain on their own right.",

They are usually chosen from the more intelligent and skilled recruits although some pirate captains tend to pick them on a whim.

As 'specialists' they enjoy a certain amount of status amongst the crews that allows them to fight in the second row. By skill and training they become over time mildly accomplished distance fighters, although their ability is somewhat hampered by their nervous and cowardly behaviour, that invalidates any even slightly more complicated tactics. Without the backup of a hefty amount of cutthroats, the scoundrels quickly become nervous and confused. always eyeing and opportunity for a tactical retreat. Even with the support of fighters their constant shifting and moving has them miss more than one good shot. Their greater survivability is paid by a lower share of the loot. Though in theory they are the same crew rank as the common cutthroats, the latter look with disdain on the scoundrels that in their eyes survive on their expense. So in loot distribution they often violently claim a bigger share - which is still only little, due to the packing order on pirat ships.

While personal guilt or curses of their victims might be the main reason for their sad existence, many of the Pirate Skeletons also own their being to their former captains who changed into powerful ghosts after they lost their human life. Again others are said to be the creation of necromancers or similar dark creatures.\nStill they seem more accustomed to killing and fighting than several other undead. Having constantly to fear to lose their lives a whole lifetime long seems to have created some fighting instincts that are still present in their old bones. More a mindless machine than anything else, they are rather weak when being on their own. Their threat increases significantly if being accompanied by a pirate ghost. Headed by a pirate ghost, Pirate Skeletons seem to obtain some of the malicious  intelligence of their leaders.",

Their main capability lies in the creating of poisons and plagues as well as to transform usually insubstantial things like despair, pain and agony into substantial tools and weapons. Although their physique makes them powerful fighters, their inherent cowardice prohibits them to rise in the ranks of demon kind. They tend to use others to do the dirty work and operate behind the scenes. More often though, they end up forced into the service of a more powerful creature.

Those who survive the first hard months eventually become quite skilled Poachers. Making little difference between animals and humans, they see anything as fitting prey which they manage to kill. Some of them work as pathfinders and trackers for some bandits, others gather in small hunting packs just like wild animals. Again others are loners - close to insanity who turn into beings that the locals call 'wild men'. Poachers can be found almost everywhere. They hunt deer and wolfs in the woods as well as rats and insects in caves. Knowing that travellers posses useful equipment and money, they don't even shrink away from murder and thievery. Poachers have little to lose and often disregard their own safety. Hoping for a lucky shot, they even attack much stronger opponents. Poachers are most dangerous when the victims are taken by surprise while being on a hunting trip. It almost seems as if they could smell the blood of a wounded adventurer as they tend to appear when someone is in a fierce fight with some wild beast. Travelling adventurers are well advised to have some backup healing material available while passing a territory known for Poacher activity.",

Pookas are capricious and fickle creatures. They can also take the form of human children and as such they often try to fool visitors to Feyrist. However, their human shape includes various animal features, such as ears or a tail. The transformed pooka will try to hide these traits, but observant travelers can tell there is something going on. Pookas emerge from mortals' dreams about gems, treasures and gold.\n\nLately, some pookas on Feyrist are tainted by a mysterious, sinister force that is threatening Feyrist as well as the rest of Tibia.

However, there came a time when a group of Fafnar's adherers became more and more influential and aggressive until this sect postulated the sole worship of Fafnar. This resulted in a religious war between the Fafnar followers and those who fought for the duality of the two sun gods. Ultimately, the war was ended by a major natural disaster that split off the eastern peninsula from the western part of the land mass. This was interpreted as a demonstration of divine wrath. It was rumoured that Suon had shattered the continent in his anger about the humans' misdeeds. From that day on, the old empire was in shambles and the worship of Fafnar is now forbidden in the new empire.\nBut the cult of Fafnar still exists on Kilmaresh, albeit in secret. Her followers go to great lengths to strengthen Fafnar's influence and try to re-establish her worship. To achieve their goals they are not above using either infiltration or violence. The Priestesses of the Wild Sun are a special branch of Fafnar's clerics. They serve the Smiter with great devotion but other than the Burning Gladiators they seek to restore Fafnar's worship by intrigues and scheming rather than brute force.",

They are quite intelligent and seem to be, together with the quara hydromancer, the leaders of this sinister race. Their tentacles make them dangerous foes. They allow the Quara Constrictor to attack more than one target at once and to grapple or strangle their helpless prey. Using the same abilities like electric eels, they are also able to stun their enemies for a short time. To stand a better chance to defeat them, you should try to fight them on land where they are somewhat weaker than swimming in water.\nOnly few of them exist and since they are somewhat cowardly by nature, you don't meet them too often in combat. If forced to fight, they are quite capable to defend themselves. They often surprise their enemies with dirty tricks and an iron resolve. This subspecies seems to be somehow responsible for modifying and altering the other quara. How exactly this is done and to which extent the Quara Constrictor is involved in these transformation processes is unknown.",

Although their power is only a fraction of the power that once ruled the murky depths of the ocean, it is still enough to be more than a match for the unsuspecting adventurer. The only chance of a more balanced fight is to challenge them ashore where they are somewhat weaker than in their maritime habitat.

One of the lowest casts are used as a kind of dumpster for unwanted and disturbing thoughts and emotions. Those unfortunate squids are forcefully filled with thoughts and emotions that are no their own. Picked from the ranks of the weakest and most instable of the squid race they soon fall victim to madness while their minds are more and more shattered. Even in this state the broken being, no longer comprehending what's happening to them are further used and flooded with foreign brain patterns. A good part of the caste withers away and dies in the process. Some though mysteriously manage to survive. Over time their own frustration and anger adds up with those that are dumped into them and this dangerous mixture is only contained by a more and more fragile mind. Sooner or later those minds just snap. This is usually noticed by their handlers far in advance and the unfortunate creatures are extracted to undergo a gruesome procedure to alter their minds and brain pattern. After all the lobotomys and inductions there is little left over then an animalistic creature that follows predetermined patterns like a golem. These creatures, known as rage squids are highly aggressive and violent and their only use is to employ them as a kind of guard or attack dog. Often accompanied by a handler, they are used in packs for war or hunts. Tempered by violence and aggression their former meager fighting skills become formidable by their training and conditioning. Only recently rumored shifts in the society of squids lead to a dramatic increase of rage squids produced. Because of this rage squids are now sometimes employed for very specific guarding tasks without any handler present.",

        "description": "Unless other creatures from beyond, the Reality Reaver seems to follow regular patterns of behaviour, as it does not cause the random destruction in the same way that others of its kind do. However, just because the Reality Reaver possesses a form that follows predictable patterns to an extend which other beings do not, it is not yet in possession of sentience.\nThis being said, the Reality Reaver is just as malignant as the rest of its ilk. However, it has certain characteristics that are more often found in ordinary creatures, whereas the other \"newly created\" are closer in nature to a tornado or a wildfire. For instance, it has been reported that it creates small flocks of its own kind in order to attack in a pack. Still, even a single Reality Reaver is a force to be reckoned with.\nThe Reality Reaver seems somewhat more stable than the rest of its kind. While the others regularly dissolve and re-form, even in the realm beyond, the Reality Reaver is more anchored in our reality and with that, one step further towards our plane of existence. It cannot be foreseen what this means for our future.\nWhether or not the current crisis can be averted, one thing is certain; an invasion of these creatures can no longer be prevented. The very existence of the Reality Reaver and its ability to manifest in a concrete form is an indication that our reality's laws of probability helps these incursions to evolve into a more stable state of existence, which makes them more dangerous. The Reality Reaver is already very dangerous and destructive, but the aspect that it evolves in our world makes the Reality Reaver even more unnerving. \nScholars have proven themselves inadequate to the task of classifying these new creatures. They have categorised them as \"forces of destruction\". Equally erroneously, they have labelled the Reality Reaver as a \"destruction golem\". This classification is so obviously wrong that it would never stand a close examination.",

Though several of them were indeed once knights that for one reason or another fell into disgrace, a greater number of them is recruited by henchmen of aforementioned knights who 'knighted' them on the field. Though in no way having a valid claim on that title, they are still called that way even by their enemies. Over time, the number of sellswords and ruffians outgrew that of the original knights, but as the degradation of the latter continued, too, often the differences vanished completely. Renegade knights tend to give their bands flashy titles and keep up the pretension of a knightly order, even though their traditions are rather a cruel mockery of the original concepts of such orders. \nWhat all renegade knights have in common is usually a lot of combat experience, regular training and decent weapons and armor. \nUsually, they behave no better than ordinary bandits if not even worse, depending of the ideals of their chosen 'order' which might involve torture and sacrifice to some dark powers. Though rarely encountered alone, they seldom fight in a battle formation, and prefer to engage enemies aggressively on their own, without much coordination. They usually bolster their ranks with all kinds of cutthroats from whom they pick the most suitable to be trained and equipped in order to be one day 'knighted' by them. \nGroups of renegade knights are often associated with some of the darker cults that suit their style and provide some amount of mysticism that pleases the vanity of their leaders, who enviously look at the true knightly orders to which in many cases they once belonged. The lower ranks are less concerned with spirituality, and care more for gold and plunder as they did before they acquired their false knighthood. \nHunted by the authorities, the renegade knights usually hide in remote areas or are constantly on the move to avoid persecution. \nWhen they acquire a steady base, it's mostly done so by forcing the former inhabitants out. Such a base usually houses not only the knights but also their lesser followers and mystics of some kind. Rarely non-human allies are allowed to stay.  ",

On the other hand, the subordinance of the other herd's leader guarantees the loyalty of their herd too. \nIn the social order of Ingol, that has been established by Dr. Marrow and his assistants, the Rrihndeers function as heavy workers as well as soldiers, guardsmen and police force. Their subordinance to the boar men has led to resentments of the former to the latter and often leads to violent clashes that the boar men only leave victorious because the rihndeers in lieu cooperate and coordinate better. \nCuriously enough due to an unexplainable oddity in their physiology, the rindeers are very fond of sugar and sweets. Yet their body reacts to sweets like to alcohol and put them into a drunken state. Even the sweetness of natural fruits an cause such effects.

        "description": "The rorcs are the creation of a power-hungry orc shaman who used water of Ashar'tel stolen from the forest furies, to emulate their fearsome strength and fury in his own warriors. His nomad tribe of orcish raiders employed a tamed variety of terrorbirds as mounts. The careless usage of the mystical water somehow mutated and fused rider and mount to a fearsome new creature, an entirely new breed of orcs, the rorcs. The shaman's delight was short lived as the changed minions were not amused by their treatment. They used their newfound prowess and scorn to overthrow and supposedly kill the shaman. Since then, the rorcs have sought out recognition by their orcish brethren. Some inherent urge drove them to seek out their own flock and reunite with them. Other orcs first greeted them with contempt. But after a first attempt of extermination failed miserably at the claws of the rorcs, the orcish warchiefs began to reconsider. For now, the rorcs are grudgingly allowed to live at the fringes of orcish territory in an uneasy alliance with their brethren. If the rorcs can prove their worth, they might be allowed to join the orcish ranks and bolster their armies. If the two breeds separate, as more and more rorc roosters demand, then the rorcs will become an unique tribe, looking for a place of their own, of course with violent force. Both options paint a dark future for neighbouring communities and the world as a whole. The rorcs are fearsome fighters, even more aggressive, single-minded and brutal than an ordinary orc. Charging into battle, they employ natural and forged weapons with ferocity. Often they are in some frenzy akin to those of the forest furies, with which they share their origin. Even in their brighter moments, they are creatures that look to prove themselves before the other orcs and their pack mates. Infightings between rorcs roosters are common and often lethal, as the orc-bird mixture leads to an aggressive pack behaviour. A severely wounded leader is often killed by some contender, even if the battle against some common enemy is still joined.",

        "description": "The so called rot elemental is of course out of the scale of normal elemental classification. Though it shares several attributes with other elementals, it lacks other distinctive features and instead has in those areas more in common with spirits or even the undead. As a matter of fact, the existence of rot elementals is another phenomenon, connected to the necromantic smog of the Rathleton area but it could be encountered at other sites that were soaked with necromantic energy at one time. Actually the ghostlands and the plains of havoc are places that have seen at least manifestations of such creatures although up to today none of them endured for a longer time. So there are obviously other facts at work in the creation and stabilization of rot elementals. As far as modern science knows, the elementals are created at sites with a considerably number of waste and carrion. This fact is disputed by the theory that the manifestation just seeks out the greatest concentration of such matter rather than needing a certain amount of it. Be it as it may, some kind of spirit is drawn to such places and makes itself felt by and overwhelming presence of decay. Mould grows extremely fast and matter decomposes in exceedingly fast rates. It's like the spirits presence would dissolve suitable matter to use it for the creation of a host body. Several tests indicate that the spirit does not really inhabit this body but rather 'rides' it, in some way using it like a puppet. The controlling spirit seems quite primordial and not a specific spirit of a person or entity. It is more a certain instinctive consciousness that seems to inhabit certain necromantic fields and that is sometimes bound by necromants to inhabit and animate dead bodies. In the case of the rot elemental this consciousness is acting on its own. This it why it's called a rot elemental at all, it manifests spontaneously, has a certain consciousness on its own and is built of a specific 'element'. As the elemental classification, despite certain efforts, does not count necromancy or rot as elemental power and the purity of rot can't be measured as well as the presence of at least some considerable part of fluid, that would be counted as another element, is present, it seemingly defies too many rules to be scientifically counted as elemental. Of course the provisionally nomenclature as spontaneous necromantic physical manifestation was never popular enough so that the name rot elemental stuck to the creature anyway. As for its behaviour, it's considered as mindlessly malignant as its only driving motive seems to be to spread death and pain without any greater plan. \nSometimes rot elementals are controlled via variants of spells that are meant to control the undead, but even such altered spells are of high risk and the elementals are known to break free in a frenzy.

They show an intelligent design but seem to lack a specific purpose. The unknown creator, if existent at all, has yet to be identified. Some speculate this creator might be some avatar of rot and decay, somehow connected to the feared pale worm, that is still stuck in its infancy. The rotten golems are seen as the first, mostly purposeless actions of this enigmatic entity. Given their destructive and malignant nature this does not bode well for the nature of its nascent creator. The golems roam certain areas of Zarganash which are ripe with rot and decay, providing an ample and fertile ground for their creation. Their behaviour is aggressive and malignant, yet more sustained by a curious cruelty than any direct malevolence. While only spotted rarely in the past, sightings of rotten golems have become more and more common recently, though their appearance seems to be limited to certain areas that they prefer. A greater spread of the rotten golems is nothing to dismissed though, given that there seems to be an increase of their activity in general.\n\nFor now they seem confined to certain areas, where they attack intruders with almost childish excitement. When not facing an enemy they seem to relish in random destruction of environment that also has similarity to a curious playing child. It's not rare that they hurt each other or themselves in such a process. This never leads to infights, however, as the others simply join the destructive play. Despite not actually fighting they still might tear each other apart out of sheer curiosity. All this lead to speculation that the rotten golems might mature over time and gain greater consciousness and intelligence. But in over 200 years from the first reports of rotten golems, such specimens have not been observed.",

Whereas a poltergeist usually haunts a specific place as invisible force that moves unliving objects, in this case the poltergeist seems to be fused with several items of scrap and litter into an undead creature that never had lived at all. Obviously this process is extremely painful for the poltergeist as is the whole further existence as rustheap creature. It seems that rotting and decaying objects over the time become charged with more and more necromantic residue energy, that they become spiritually sticky for some forms of spirits. Those imbued parts of junk eventually stick themselves to an unwilling spirit host and attract even more imbued junk over the time until the whole spirit soaked into a pile of necromantic junk. Thereby the poltergeists that are usually bound to a place or an object become mobile on their own but under the price of constant pain and strain as they feel their new junk body decay. Their answer to their misery is usually to lash out at everyone they might encounter. It is said that attacks of rustheap golems are especially painful because the creature transmits some of its own pain through the wounds into its victim, easing it's own suffering in the process. Without any real purpose and bound to an existence of suffering the rustheap creatures roam abandoned places oddly enough attracted by junk and decay. Some are even known to create their own lairs of junk and trash, probably in resemblance of their old place bound habits. It is impossible to exorcise a spirit our of their new junk bodies and it is yet unknown what happens to the original poltergeist when it's junk body is destroyed. Some assume the aggressiveness of the rusheap creatures simply aims at provoking it's own destruction but the fierceness with which this creatures fight suggest otherwise. ",

In Gnomeprona it's just another hunter, competing for food and sometimes ending up as such for other, even more vicious predators. Yet the sabretooth adapted quite well to the harsh environment, having numerous litters of kits frequently and being very protective towards their offspring, the predatory cats don't take long to reach adulthood. \nThe young sabretooth's are extremely agile, fast and stealthy. Still a lot of them fall prey to one of the other primal hunters. \nDespite all their abilities and the protection provided by their mother, only a small fraction of them reaches adulthood at all. \nA fully grown Sabretooth, however, often lives a long life and has astonishing regenerative abilities that let them survive wounds that would have left other creatures dying or maimed. As such wounds still leave their distinctive marks, some of the more recognizable cats could be re-recognized and thereby verified to reach relatively long life spans. As the first expeditions to Gnomprona are a relatively recent things further date on that matter had to be gathered though. \nThey tend to have small lairs hidden deeply in thickets and often hunt in small packs. Their hunting habits resemble more that of wolf packs then those of the larger cats on the ground. Now and then they seem to form super packs, in which several packs band together. It's a rare occurrence and seldom witnessed by an observer who lives to tell the tale. In fact it's so rare that it even might be a myth, based on coincidence. Anecdotical tales mention that such packs viciously attack each and everything in its way, bringing down even the most fierce foes by sheer strength in numbers. \nThere are hints that the sabretooth population almost spread to other subterranean areas in the past. Skeletons found in the caves in a wide area around Gnomprona prove, that now and then a sabretooth ventured deep into the surrounding tunnels.

        "description": "The Salamander is a creature that is quite common in swamp areas. In this harsh environment only the most aggressive and capable individuals can survive, so that the relatively harmless Salamander has evolved into a creature that can scare off at least some attackers. However, a Salamander is still an easy prey and so it often relies on the protection granted by its colouring. The diet of the Salamanders are smaller insects that are often found in abundance in their habitat. Only this allows for the continued survival of the Salamander species while surrounded by more powerful predators. The Salamanders are considered very distant relatives of the dragons, an assumption that is based solely on the fact that they are lizards and have a penchant to collect hoards. The so-called 'hoards' of the Salamanders usually consist only of a few shiny things they have gathered in the swamp, typically junk discarded or lost by adventurers in the area. Still, sometimes they are hunted by foolhardy soldiers of fortune who dream about an easy way to acquire some exotic treasure. Due to their tasting odd, Salamanders are hunted by trolls and orcs for food when times are dire. Sometimes local witches breed Salamanders as familiars, or as ingredients for their cooking or even alchemical usage.",

Once confined to this isle, the semi-aquatic insect became an accidental traveller on ships which restocked their supplies on this isle. This led to the spreading of  Sandcrawlers all over the known world. Extremely adaptive, they are mainly encountered in sand areas and despite their semi-aquatic nature, they are often found in the seemingly hostile climate of deserts and other desolate places. The Sandcrawler can endure extreme climates and periods of starvation with ease. They are not overly aggressive but they also know no fear. When they focus on one thing, their efforts are relentless and untiring. They usually do not prey on bigger creatures, and there is no aggression in their attacks, just frightening determination. Since they do not build huge colonies but rather live in small groups, it is wise to destroy each nest entirely to prevent further spreading of these creatures. Although they usually live in sandy areas, they often also move to more fertile areas. In their recklessness,  they often cause much harm, and only a few Sandcrawlers can destroy a whole field.",

        "description": "The scorpion was the symbol of the ancient dynasties of the southern desert. For the early civilisation it was the embodiment of war and deadliness. The symbol of the scorpion is found at many different sites. Statues of scorpions used to be quite common in temples. Ancient mystics filled some of these statues with actual spirits of scorpions, or at least with something of what they thought to be such spirits. The repeated binding of spirits into the statues granted them some resemblance to living scorpions. Even when the mystics disappeared, the Sandstone Scorpions persisted. Forgotten in ancient tombs, they endured the ravages of time. Since every grain of sand in the statues is imbued with spirit energy, the sandstone bodies can be destroyed but not killed. Given some time, the seemingly dead body will crumble into sand that moves with a wind that no other can feel to some place where it will reform its former body to continue its existence.\nThe poison they use is rather spiritual than physical. The study of this poison led to the refinement of antidote magic as we know it today. Instead of countering poison with the help of regenerative powers as it was custom practice in the past, modern antidote magic rather exorcises the poison itself. While some temples tie this process to the god Crunor who allowed the humans to learn the secret of poison curing, most scientifically inclined magic users see only a mindless but dangerous machine in the Sandstone Scorpion. They argue that it is only following orders of summoners long dead. On the other hand, priests argue that the Sandstone Scorpion is the embodiment of an animal spirit and therefore sacred to Crunor. They claim that it is working on Crunor's behalf, testing the battle prowess of heroes. Both interpretations admit though that the Sandstone Scorpion is a formidable foe that is guarding the holy places of the past.",

For a long time Sea Serpents were exiled into the world of fairy tales just like the bogeyman or the man in the cave. However, during the years of the serpents, it became shockingly clear that Sea Serpents are a horrible reality. For many years, hordes of Sea Serpents made the ship passage between Carlin and Svargrond impassable. Then, almost over night, they vanished as suddenly as they had appeared. Still, sightings of Sea Serpents are not uncommon nowadays. Sea Serpents are omnivores but prefer meat over seaweed and tang. They hunt seals, sharks, octopuses and small whales, and occasionally also quara. The quara are in a strange relationship with the Sea Serpents. Some of them worship single Sea Serpents like gods, while others organise large hunting parties to exterminate Sea Serpents that enter their territory.\nNormally, Sea Serpents are afraid of the strange ships humans tend to travel with. Some of them, however, seem to have overcome their fear. Those Sea Serpents attack ships with all their strength, and they are able to destroy even the biggest ships that cruise the seas. If they are able to wreck a whole ship, one can imagine what a single diver or swimmer has to expect from these beasts. While most Sea Serpents avoid the noisy big ships, a single human is always a welcome snack. Sea Serpents attack immediately, and only the fact that they are not used to meet with resistance might be an advantage of their victims.",

The shadow pupils themselves are uncommunicative to the point of being cryptic, and when addressed either reply very monosyllabically or ambiguously, as if answering something, or someone, else. They can be found where light and darkness intermingle, and seem to be monitoring things as well as building some strange shades, shrines or artificially interlaced bone piles of yet unknown use. Often, they are seen to draw strange faces or gruesome, half animal half demon-like shapes on the floors, that none dare step on. The other dark summoners suspect those to be portals to a shadow realm, and that the shadow order plots for total dominion and seeks to cloak the world in some strange unlight. Some even say that the shadow pupils are in fact not men, but several shadows inhabiting a body together, trying to prepare the way for some demonic shadow being or planning to shroud the world, consuming all living beings therein, until nothing but shadows remain. As those words savour strongly of paranoia, other necromancers do not like to dwell upon these reflections, and just try not to mention or catch the eye of a shadow pupil. ",

        "description": "As a subterranean race spread all over the world, the Shapers had become subject to gnomish espionage. Although the gnomes claim to have no useful knowledge about the ancient Shaper wisdom and technology, they were willing to share a great deal of their information about the Shapers' social structures.\nThe Shaper Matriarch is a creature of vile cunning. They are the last keepers of oral knowledge from a time of fortune long past. They harbour an immense hatred for other creatures because they blame them for the downfall of their race. \nIn their twisted view of the world, everything belonged to their race once. For this reason, it is only logical for them to take back what they believe is rightfully theirs. Mercilessly they punish every other race for their losses. They enjoy trapping and torturing other creatures. Very often they can be seen guiding small herds of Shaper followers to lay ambushes and place traps around their lairs. \nThe Shaper Matriarchs are able to use ancient artefacts and fractures of once complicated and potent spells to harm their opponents. However, they lack true magical abilities, or even a deeper understanding of what they are doing.\nTheir status amongst the Shapers is not only based on their knowledge, but also on the fact that females are a rare sight there. What is more, their ability to 'give birth' is the foundation of their influence over the simple minds of their kin.\nThey are often the initiators and leaders of ancient rituals which are passed from matriarch to matriarch. However, with the passing of ages the original meaning of these rituals has been lost.\nEven though the Shaper Matriarchs are theoretically intelligent enough to converse with other races, they show no interest in doing so. Their language is unfamiliar to any known species. Although the Shapers used to interact with other races in the past, the Shaper Matriarchs are either unable or unwilling to speak the common tongue.\nA single Shaper Matriarch usually oversees a 'family' of roughly a dozen male Shapers. The Shaper Matriarchs are responsible for the distribution of work and resources in their groups. All males belong to her, however, the trading of males between matriarchs seems common. In less populated areas, the Shaper Matriarchs occasionally interact with each other. Usually, however, the herds peacefully tend to themselves.\nIn highly populated settlements, the Shaper Matriarchs organise in a coven which is overseen by a grand matriarch. The matriarchs use the coven to share their wisdom and to make decisions concerning the fate of their colony. Since the Shapers hold age in high regard, the grand matriarch is usually the oldest of her kin.\nWhile the lifespan of male Shapers is usually shorter than the one of humans, matriarchs can easily reach 100 years of age. They stay fertile until the day they die.  \nThere are rumours about a grand matriarch, hidden somewhere in an almost intact Shaper structure, who even oversees the other grand matriarchs. However, as long as this has not been proven, it can only be considered a myth.  ",

        "description": "The shock head is a strange hybrid mix of a demon and a nightmare creature. It is impossible to tell if these creatures were once bred on purpose or if they are just some strange freak of nature. Their demonic nature gives them a more physical and reality-bound body, as well as the ability to breed. Their nightmarish origin bestows them several unique abilities and the resistance to the nightmare-ridden areas of Roshamuul. \nThe shock head is disturbingly well suited to survive even in environments most hostile to life. To describe it as omnivore is an understatement since it does not only devour plants, meat and carrion without prejudice, it also consumes minerals, blood, life energy and even dreams. Its digestive system compresses everything that is not exploitable into rocklike structures that can be spat out like a bullet. Probably due to natural selection, the shock head population is extremely resilient, aggressive and dangerous. The regenerative powers of these creatures have captured the attention of alchemists that are trying to use several parts of the shock head as substitutes in health potions. Their eye-like organs are not used for vision, but as a weapon that can confuse foes in a distance and temporarily drains their skills. Lacking any form of intelligence, the shock heads are mindless beasts that roam the ruins of Roshamuul where they originated. Occasionally, large packs of shock heads band together at coastal areas for a strange ritual in which they howl to the moon in disharmonious unison, which is rumoured to drive listeners mad and trap them in eternal nightmares. Oddly enough, their bestial minds can be overwritten by certain means and they can be tamed. This process seems to be a permanent one, and has led to the shock heads leaving their original habitat of Roshamuul and breeding at other places. Inattentive and unscrupulous tamers helped to spread these creatures, and so they may be encountered in other places, since each following generation displays the normal wild and dangerous behaviour rather than that of their docile parents.",

        "description": "While animated skeletons possess no intelligence at all and are only driven by some universal evil, a Skeleton Warrior is indeed an independent and intelligent creature. Most Skeleton Warriors came into existence by free choice of will. Many of them used to be heroes or dutiful soldiers in life who volunteered to become the eternal guardian of some object or place. During their life, they were prepared for their eternal guard duty: they were trained in meditation, tattooed with powerful magic runes, and participated in arcane rituals.\nAfter their death, they are dressed in their best ceremonial armor which has further enchantments. For a while the corpse is as inanimate like any other corpse. Instead of rotting, these corpses slowly become mummified in the course of time. At some point, which may take years to reach, the Skeleton Warrior will rise into its undead existence. As Skeleton Warriors are unable to communicate, it is unknown where their consciousness resides in the time between death and resurrection. It is assumed by mages that the risen Skeleton Warrior usually begins his guard duty in a more or less sane state of mind. In the course of years, the once devoted warrior becomes more and more aware of his state and the consequences of his decision. Such knowledge slowly erodes the minds of all but the most stable beings. Moreover, the spells preserving the guardians are often more powerful than the ones on the guarded objects. So often, the guarded object is destroyed after some time leaving the Skeleton Warrior without any purpose. This ultimate futility of their sacrifice breaks the mind of even the most strong-minded individuals and turns them into undead killing machines, not very different from any other undead. In the end, only few of them are still capable of truly fulfilling their duty which means to kill only those that are not allowed to enter the guarded places. Often enough it occurred that an unsuspecting priest visited a guarded place and was killed by a Skeleton Warrior that he had helped to prepare for his eternal duty.\nPhysically the Skeleton Warrior combines undead strength and resilience with the prowess of his former life. This and the formidable equipment make Skeleton Warriors to a significant threat to anyone unlucky enough to find one of the places that they are guarding.",

        "description": "What an embarrassing defeat to be ambushed and beaten by a Slug. However, this scenario has become a shocking truth. Several forms of Slugs have been raised like cattle by various races such as the orcs and goblins since the dawn of time. It is questionable whether some of the prehistoric Slug rancher came up with the idea to breed some kind of battle Slugs or if some free roaming Slugs adapted to the constant danger by other races. It is quite likely that both effects went hand in hand. Anyhow, the Slug as we know it today was the result of this process. The Slug might not be a fearsome fighter but it has adapted to the constant threat to their race by developing resilience and an acid spitting capability that at least keeps their hunters somewhat at bay. Nevertheless, Slugs are still the favourite diet of several races and especially orcs consider Slug acid a spice.\nMost other giant Slug races are only known from orc and goblin myths since today's Slug successfully took over most habitats including even some from other races. This led to the incident known as the great Slug plague. In a rare and (unintentionally) combined effort of humans, dwarfs, elves, orcs, goblins and others, the Slugs were hunted, their eggs were destroyed where discovered, and poisoned traps were placed in their habitats. What most races, like the humans, conveniently left out in their history books is still known today among the goblin race as the 'Great Slug Wars'. The Slugs finally (and fittingly slowly) came back after the great purge, decimated, beaten, but not defeated. Slowly, the Slugs recovered and started to show up at unexpected places. Still, any greater Slug population often provokes attacks from Slug hunters. Also, still many races consider Slugs, their acid and their eggs a delicacy. For these reasons, greater populations have become uncommon.",

It is assumed that they not only function as the long arm of their master, but also as his eyes, enabling him to sight what is happening in the vicinity of his 'son'. When encountered in the realm of man, Sons of Verminor are usually just a shambling ever-hungry mass that tries to consume everything that it can catch.

Sometimes, however, the corruption rather touches the soul than the body. Sometimes, this goes unnoticed by those affected and those close to them. Sometimes, this leads to erratic behaviour, morbid fascinations, or a violent temper. Sometimes, the corruption goes unnoticed for a whole lifetime. Only in death those who are touched by the corruption learn the horrid truth about their nature. The taint in their soul twists their nature and refuses them the afterlife that awaited them. They are bound to the realm of the mortals in an ethereal form, tormented by an eternal hunger and plagued by their twisted vision of the world around them. They perceive the world as rotten and flawed, worth to be destroyed. Everything that exists is a pain to them, particularly if it is alive. Destruction and total oblivion seem to be the only salvation for them. Since their new ethereal body is inherently flawed, they constantly burn up spiritual energy in a rate that leaves them in a constant state of hunger. To satisfy this hunger, they feed on the vital force and soul energy of mortals. They absorb them by touch, although the most powerful of them drain the needed energy by their mere presence. Often, nothing more than mummified husks are left over from their victims.When the worst hunger is satisfied, they are cunning and relatively patient. They love to toy with their victims, but what they love the most is introducing them to their own twisted view of the world by demoralising the mortals, or shattering their dreams in some way. Quite soon though, their hunger takes over and they lose all interest in games and greedily feast on their prey.",

        "description": "The Sparkions are some of the more stable creatures from beyond, only surpassed by the reality reaver. It took several weeks to defeat an already severely injured Sparkion.\nEven though they seem to be closest to mindless automatons, they often show very specific individual patterns of behaviour which they do not share with other Sparkions. Some even argue that Sparkions do not exist at all, but only a group of very similar, yet different forms of unlife. On the other hand, most Sparkions show at least some common characteristics, such as strength or the tenacity with which goals are being pursued.\nWhile many of the new creatures often act irrationally, the Sparkion rarely stops before it has finished what it started. Then again it must be said that the goal of a Sparkion can be anything, e.g. the extinction of all life in a certain area - and this does not necessarily look purposefully for an outsider.\nIt is one of the most disturbing characteristics of the Sparkion to destroy and devastate everything around it, leaving a formless mass of matter which resembles the realm of the Sparkion's origin. Warnings are voiced that the vortexes need to be stopped; otherwise, swarms of Sparkions will eventually stream out of them to prepare our world for an ending at which everything we know is going to be sucked into the void and devoured. So far, however, the Sparkions seem to be only one of many forces from beyond. Also, no massive amassment has been witnessed yet, and it is totally inconceivable that a guiding force with a conscious plan exists.\nHowever, it is quite alarming that Sparkions are often seen carrying loads of material, such as stones, tree stumps and even corpses into the vortexes. Yet, several expeditions into the vortexes could not figure out what has happened to aforementioned materials on the other side of the vortexes. The most likely theory is that the materials are used to stabilize or even grow the realm beyond. This, however, would suggest that something greater and more powerful is guiding the mindless Sparkions' actions after all.",

For most ghosts it takes great effort to maintain some sort of sentience. Most end as drifting memories of the past, driven by emotions they do no longer understand. But some sinister beings are aware of the fate that looms above them. They research forbidden knowledge and forge dark pacts in time. This allows them to rise as a sentient and powerful form of ghost, known to those with mystical knowledge as Spectre. Spectres usually posses some being that functions as shell that they have prepared during lifetime. Often they use beings to which they have a strong emotional bond like family members. In the long run, the Spectres' puppets die away and leave the Spectre stranded in the world of mortals without a suitable host. Some succumb to madness when recognising it, others turn their frustration into hatred towards humanity. Being enemies of all things alive, they both pose a great threat to mortals.",

While individually their power to suppress magical abilities is minor, in groups, they can silence entire armies of sorcerers.

But the Anuma conferred the dominance over Kilmaresh to the humans, in an effort to let them take responsibility of their own. However, after the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar and the cataclysm that severed the continent, the Anuma took the reign over Kilmaresh back - for the humans' own benefit as they said.\n\nAs all Anuma, sphinxes are highly intelligent and allegedly immortal, though they can die by lethal violence. Some of them love riddles, others are more interested in stories, poems or songs. Many sphinxes are benevolent, yet some are rather merciless and dangerous. All of them can be short-tempered if they feel that a human being will not accept their well-meant guidance. Sphinxes are physically powerful but possess inherent magical skills as well. They tend to test the worth of those seeking their help by asking them riddles or intricate philosophical questions. Mortals will encounter sphinxes in the vast steppe of Kilmaresh as well as in the ruins of ancient sites where they guard the treasures and secrets of the lost empire.",

They are known to devour any refuse and corpses in the range of the hive. The distinction between their purposes seems artificial, though. For the hive their purpose is probably only one - to get rid of unwanted stuff. They fulfil all their tasks with frightening precision and diligence. Their endless assaults wear down any resistance and their senses are even more keen than those of other hive creatures. They are perfect war machines that know no fear or mercy, yet, they display some cunning traits to retreat or to lure an opponent into ambushes when outnumbered or hard-pressed. The enigmatic appearance of the Spidris touches something subconsciously in the human mind and strikes fear into the hearts of those who encounter them on the battlefield. The fighting style of the Spidris is considered exceedingly cruel and unnecessarily destructive. They are known to waste a considerable amount of time to mutilate the bodies of slain enemies before continuing the fight.\nIn the fight against the Deeplings, the Spidris are often used in the later phases. When the enemy is weakened and tired, the arrival of the Spidris on the battlefield alone may turn the tides of battle. With quick strikes and fast advances, the Spidris are most effective when fighting smaller groups of opponents whose formation has been shattered. The main body of the Spidris is usually hold back until the battle turns either in favour or against the Hive Born. Then the Spidris rush in to either achieve victory in a most gruesome and bloody manner, or they are sent to throw back the probably overconfident enemy.",

        "description": "Although the spittle of these creatures servers as a formidable weapon in combat, the Spitters original purpose for the hive seems to be entirely different.\nThe Spitter can obviously produce quite different kinds of spittle. The most often observed feature is the ability to use some kind of gooey spittle that can trap smaller opponents and that becomes hard and resilient when drying up. It is often used to repair hive structures on the fly or even to erect some structures such as barricades when used by larger groups of Spitters. Since it takes some time to harden, it is only annoying and disgusting for bigger opponents such as humans, for this reason this kind of spittle is rarely seen in combat. In battle, they rather use their corrosive spittle. The use of this kind of spittle outside of war is somewhat up to speculations. It seems possible that it is used to dissolve hive structures that are no longer needed. The dissolved structures can be devoured by several of the hive creatures and later be used as construction material again. Adventurers that made forays into the deeper hive observed a third use of the spittle which seems the most important for the hive. The Spitters are the main feeders of the larvae in the hive. This kind of spittle seems nutritious for the Hive Born. It is not only important for their growth but also determines what kind of creature the larvae will evolve into. Though it has been assumed that there are three entirely different strains of Spitters, several observations disproved this theory. The Spitters are able to shift the usage of their spittle with little effort. They can be encountered almost everywhere in the hive although most times, they are only found in the major structures. Only in times of war considerable numbers of Spitters are seen far away from the hive. They serve as distance fighters and therefore play an important role in the composition of the melee-heavy hive armies.",

This lead to an extreme specialised cast-like system in which the squid warden served as a kind of police force. Favouring secret knowledge as source of power, they follow a complex set of rules and laws that are not commonly known. They are often found patrolling extremely important and holy places dedicated to Zathroth and his principles. Bread as enforcers they have a formidable array of offensive powers, can not be bribed and hardly reasoned with. They seamlessly blend magic and their natural telepathy with frightening efficiency and seem impervious to pain thanks to their willpower. Due to their for outsiders incomprehensible behavior patters that follow their own secret rules, they are not well-liked by other Zathroth worshipers. \nThe higher ranks in the cult, however, employ them nonetheless and willingly accept a few casualties in the own ranks when someone breaks the unspoken rules of the wardens. Though able to communicate with others than their own race, they almost never lower themselves to argue with or explain themselves to other creatures, which they see only with contempt.

They have an unexplainable weakness for music though and sometimes can be soothed by it. The kind of music the squid warden fancies however, would be considered cacophonic by other beings, so finding the 'right tune' to please them is rather impossible.",

And they don't shun away from creating such corpses by physical force at all.\nWith quite an arsenal of natural weaponry they actively attack when they are 'fertile'. \nWhile out of seeds to spread, the stalking stalks become inert and hide in the thickets by perfect mimicry, becoming inanimate and appearing as a perfect copy of a number of other plants common in Gnomprona. \nThis ability has fascinated scientists as the stalking stalk seems not limited to one form to shift into. There are experiments in progress that try to find out how exactly this ability works and how the limits are defined. Specific stalks seem to be limited to a set amount of other plants to mimic, though those might vary from stalk to stalk. To entice the stalks to shift into any plant which is not native to Gnomprona have not yet met any success at all.\nTheir resilient seeds are even more dangerous to the carrion eaters of Gnomprona. The seeds often resist most digestive tracts of the local creatures, but more often than not begin to sprout while still in the stomachs of such creatures. The blooming stalk takes root in the intestines of it's victim and begins to grow util it finally kills it's carrier and a new stalking stalk bursts out. The dependence on such hosts leads to another odd characteristic of its sprout, as it closely resembles that of other, harmless plants, likely to entice other creatures to eat them and become their new host, as they are able to regress their essence back into a new seed to sprout again. It's easy to assume but next to impossible to proof the shared heritage of the stalks with other known animated plants that are way more common on the surface world and it's debatable if such plants lost some of the stalking stalks abilities in more fertile areas or if the stalks evolved separately and developed such features only 'recently' to cope with Gnomprona's hostile environment.

Others claim that the Stampor must be some surviving experiment of an ancient and now extinct race. Another faction sees the Stampor as an ordinary animal with a high affinity to the element earth. All of them base their theories on the Stampor's astonishing abilities which nonetheless seem rather natural and not based on magic at all. Be it as it may, the Stampors that have been encountered were quite powerful and often a threat to travellers. This is not caused by an unusual aggressiveness of the Stampor, but rather on their stupidity and bad eyesight. They seem to mistake unknown intruders as members of other Stampor herds which they try to drive off. While a Stampor is very resilient and tough and can easily withstand the 'friendly poking' and spitting, for an ordinary human such friendly warnings can become life-threatening. They seem to be drawn to places aligned to elemental earth in some way and there were sightings of Stampors in areas to which they would be physically unable to travel. Of course this only fuelled rumours and the above mentioned theories, though none of this sightings could be confirmed, yet.",

They are also alarmingly not territorial. Their packs wander the depths aimlessly, devouring and destroying everything in their way.

        "description": "The stone rhino is a strange, reclusive beast that lives in remote areas. Despite its threatening appearance, it's a mostly harmless herbivore that tends to itself. Sadly, the stone rhino is also highly territorial and easily provoked.  The stone rhino sees everything as a threat and doesn't hesitate to attack. In addition to its remarkable size and strength, stone rhino is also armed with a dangerous horn on its nose which makes it a formidable opponent. With this weapon the stone rhino is able to fend off most of its natural enemies with ease. However, some super predators like dragons hunt the stone rhino for the challenge and keep its population low. \nThe stone rhinosv prefer spots of grassland in the wilderness where they can lazily graze the whole day undisturbed. Some individuals and groups have even adapted to a life in the woods, although this only happens rarely. The stone rhino seems rather clumsy and slow when watched from afar. However, more than one explorer has been surprised by the eruption of speed and force a stone rhino can burst into as soon as it gets angry. To anger a stone rhino is not only a particularly stupid thing to do, it is also quite easily accomplished. The stone rhino may watch an approaching foreigner while slowly chewing grass, not showing any sign of unease. In the next moment it will lower its head and attack. It is advisable to give the stone rhino a wide berth. If a stone rhino attacks you, the smartest thing to do is run. Even if the stone rhino is quicker, its manoeuvrability is extremely limited, especially while attacking. For this reason, one might be able to dodge the stone rhino's attack. With some luck, the stone rhino will lose interest and give up the chase.\nEfforts to domesticate these creatures have not been overly successful yet. Only the ogres have had some isolated successes. These triumphs were mainly based on the ogres' strength with which they are at least partly able to domesticate the stone rhino. \nThere are theories that the stone rhinos were created by some magician or an ancient race and that it might be related to the fabled unicorn or the chimaera. However, these theories are still to be proven. The story that the ugly stone rhino visits a hidden magical pond when it feels its end is imminent can be discounted as myth. The dying stone rhino takes a bath in this pond in the light of the full moon. After that bath the stone rhino exits the waters as a beautiful winged creature which it stays for the rest of the night, only to die in the morning. \nRecently hunters started to prey upon the stone rhino. There are rumours that part of the stone rhino's horn will keep the sword of an adventurer sharp and rigid. Those unfounded assertions have not only led to a decline of the stone rhino population but also to senseless injuries and the death of several unskilled wannabe hunters who underestimated the stone rhino.

        "description": "It seems highly likely that the streaked devourers are a more adolescent version of the usually more numerous cave devourers. It's debatable if the factor in this change is really physical age or just the amount or quality of devoured material, but such thoughts become pointless when confronted with a ravenous mass of teeth that want to destroy you. Their power and ferociousness are strengthened over time as is their toughness. It's still driven by eternal hunger and shows no more restraint in following it's primal impulses than his younger self did.\nBefore entering the transformation into a streaked devourer, the creature swells to twice its size and becomes rather slow. In such a phase it's extremely vulnerable and can hardly fight back. The transformation takes place in a couple of weeks in which the devourer retreats to a remote spot. In the end of the transformation the devourer sheds its old skin which had dried up and wrinkled away over time.\nSometimes a devourer that is transitioning into the next phase becomes immobile and over time turns more and more into stone. It is probable that such specimens lack the right minerals to go through the whole transformative process to become a streaked devourer.\nIn very rare occasions some specimens were encountered in a phase to transition between stages, but such creatures seem to seek out remote places and commit to their transition completely. The streaked devourers are usually loners and highly territorial. Thus infights are common, though rarely deadly. Only through some outer influence they are coerced into cooperation. If part of an army for long enough, their attitude to unwanted company seems to soften up a bit and they learn to cease their aggression even without constant supervision.\nThe pheromone that streaked devourers mark their territory with is, in case of the 'domestic' counterparts, used in advance packs to mark a path that the main army can follow up later. Gnomish special operation teams reported some success in diverting armies in certain direction due to the use of salvaged pheromone glands.\nAs streaked devourers become more and more magnetic over time, in some cases movements of greater numbers of streaked devourers could be tracked by using a compass.",

        "description": "The peculiar flora and fauna of Gnomprona hosts a tremendous amount of unique life forms. The discovery of the land in the depths of Tibia sparked a debate, if it rather preserves or created the special creatures encountered there. The current consensus seems to be something in-between. It seems likely that many of the gnompronean life forms are primordial ancestors of creatures encountered elsewhere in the world. Yet it seems likely that centuries of generations, tempered by the harsh primeval land have left their mark and changed the creatures over the course of time. The sulphur spider seems to belong to one of the latter cases. At first classified by some to be an elemental and less an actually creature, closer inspections of slain spiders have disproven this by far and wide. In fact these spiders are probably the progenitors of many of the gigantic spiders that can be found all over the world. Despite their visual familiarity to creatures like the crystal spiders they share more in arrangement of their organs with the well-known giant spider. This turned former scientific theories upside down and now scientists lean towards the theory that the sulphider is the evolution of a progenitor spider as the shared ancestor for sulphider, giant and crystal spiders and probably many else. Yet the special dependency their offspring developed towards sulphur seems to hint that they took quite a different branch of development. Still the sulphider is assumed to be the most closely related offspring of the bunch, when compared towards that progenitor spider. \nThey build their lairs in sulphuric areas and their hairy body is usually covered with a layer of sulphur powder. Yet their skin tone has taken a yellowish hue, probably over many generations. Oddly enough their choice of lairs in rather uninviting areas of sulphuric caves, cracks and fields makes it necessary for them to venture into the gnomorean jungle to find prey. There they stand with their hue and are easily spotted. They make up for that by being very quick and agile, catching up to their victims with terrifying speed. As their whole bodies seem highly satiated with sulphur and derived, concentrated toxins, their yellow colouring also serves as a warning towards other predators to stay away. Indeed the flesh of the sulphider is highly poisonous and even a bite seems to cause any attacker discomfort and harm. ",

        "description": "The sulphur spouter seems to be an elemental and less an actually creature by classification. While other fringe theories suggest that the spouters are just heaps of sulphur possessed and animated by some kind of nature spirit and more related to fairies and pixies there is no proof to support such claims. Whatever their true origin might be, they are on the intelligence level of an animal and able to act on purpose and with an agenda in a limited way. Why this agenda usually seems to involve violence and destruction is not known though. \nThe spouter seems not to rely on any form of sustenance but it seems somewhat to 'recharge' in proximity to naturally occurring sulphur. Therefore the spouter are usually found close to natural occurrences of sulphur like volcanic cracks. \nThere are some vague hints that the sulphur spouters are not native to Gnomprona but migrated there from somewhere else. They seem to be relatively 'new' to the area, though new in the case of such primordial place still means an enormous amount of time to mortal creatures. As their corpses leave distinctive marks on earth, e4xcacvations revealed that such marks are missing in the deepest layers where still bones and other remains were found. \nThe fact that the spouters seem keen to attack explorers and destroy artificial structures not native to the subterranean realm at times lead some to believe that they are somehow remotely controlled or following certain orders imprinted on them. While some think they might have been some kind of pets or servants of an extinct intelligent race that once dwelt in Gomprona, more paranoid Gnomes suggest that they might actually be agents of those below. Serving them as eyes and ears somehow and to link the activity of those below in the area to the recognition of gnomish presence by those creatures. Both theories have little evidence to prove their point of view though. \nAs of now these peculiar creatures remain largely an enigma to science. The fact that captured sulphur spouters die within a few days for no discernible reason, makes any research in that matter complicated at best.",

They are a mixture of plant and animal and are at least partially intelligent. Though it will not react to attempts of communication in any other way than by attacking, it is considered to be an established fact that the Swampling has some ability to react and plan ahead in ways unknown to most animals. Swamplings are known to build simple traps, set ambushes and to make use of the surroundings to kill their prey. Though it seems that Swamplings can live on water and fertile soil for indefinite periods of time, they prefer to spice up their diet with the corpses of once living beings. The Swamplings seem to prefer intelligent beings to mere animals as their prey. It is assumed that the cause for this is not necessity, but rather the Swampling's evil nature.\nThe Swampling population in the known world has survived many attempts to purge them from certain areas or from existence as a whole by the sentient races. Even the most successful attempts have only managed to drive them back for a while though. It has to be assumed that the Swampling seeds take incredibly long to grow and lie dormant for years before they begin to sprout. Some theories assume they might mimic other plants in their growth phase until maturity and then rapidly change into their known and mobile form. There are at least no reports of Swampling saplings ever having been encountered. The Swamplings usually prefer humid areas with fertile soil but sometimes, small colonies can be found in otherwise unsuitable areas where they can prey upon intelligent beings or do them some kind of harm. Ancient reports from Darama tell about remote oases that were plagued by Swamplings who lay in wait for weakened travellers and even poisoned the water supply to ensure the demise of their victims.",

They emit pheromones to coordinate their efforts, and even when their fast movements seem aimless and unprovoked sometimes, they always serve some hidden purpose. With the help of pheromones and touch, they seem to have some form of communication with each other. They are often seen to act as one, effortlessly moving in patterns that often mirror those of the other Swarmers. This strange connection of the Swarmers seems not to extend to their hive brethren, though. It has been observed that irritated Swarmers attacked other hive creatures and sometimes even devour them. When in a food frenzy, they are often compared to the feared piranhas.\nSwarmers seem always eager to collect biomass for the hive one way or the other. This often means the devouring of living matter, be it plants, garbage or living creatures. Brought back to the hive, it is stored as a putrid, half-digested mass. It is assumed that Swarmers also feed other Hive Born, particularly the kollos. Swarmers are assumed to be the most numerous of the Hive Born although not necessarily the ones most often encountered. Daring adventurers that have torn down hive constructs claimed to have found Swarmers in hollow areas and tunnels under the layers of the walls or the floors. What they have done there, remains a mystery.\nThis is just one, even though the main strain of Swarmers that can be encountered. It seems the hive can breed another strain for defensive purposes in great numbers in a short time. Those Swarmers have an extremely short lifespan, however, often only measured in hours. In the war over the isle, the Swarmers are the foremost shock troops. They are used in great numbers to wear down opponents and to distract them from more valuable warriors. They suffer enormous casualties, although, it seems the hive's supply of them is limitless. Most casualties arise in the easy replaceable short-living strain, though, and so the losses for the hive are probably marginal.",

Sadly their appetite extends to all other kind of organic substances, including livestock and sentient beings. Given the insatiable appetite of a Terramite colony, the potential for destruction caused by an unhindered population is extreme. Both, the orcs and the lizard people, consider the Terramites as delicacies.\nUsually the Terramites are content with the things they find in the underground but if the colony is starving, some scouts are sent out to look for more fertile areas. They consider each and everything they find in the earth as potential food, and the unlucky fellow that curiously explores one of their mounds, learns soon enough about their warlike welcome for any intruder.\nUnlike other insects, Terramites are generalists and lack the distinction between workers, warriors and queens. This makes it rather difficult to extinguish a colony. It is unknown what - instead of a queen - holds a colony together, but a Terramite colony seems to run effectively even without a leader.",

On the other hand, nests of Terror Birds have been found, so this theory does not seem to be very likely. Be that as it may, the name of this feared hunter is more than justified. The aggressive bird attacks everything that comes in its sight with rage that does indeed inspire fear and dread. The carnivorous Terror Bird seems to regard everything as its rightful prey and its sharp beak often proves it right.

Terrorsleeps avoid the sunlight as it stuns and disorientates them. They do not see as we do, but sense other creatures' body warmth and fear. Hungry, toothed mouths protrude on their head instead of eyes. Using their mouths like augers, they bite open their victims and bathe in their bloody carcass like birds in a water pool. Terrorsleeps have very light and flexible bones and can squeeze through anywhere. They particularly like to slither and slime through dark, dank places, searching and sniffing out anything warm, alive; feeding on its fear, coveting its warmth, sucking out its life force. Their whitish belly is swollen with terror juices that foam up as gooey, frothy saliva hanging in threads and webs from their bared teeth. Touching it instils horrible paranoia and paralyses the victim so that the terrorsleep can devour it. Their putrid, blood-soaked wings they use to stabilise themselves and to swim or soar through darkness to reach ever deeper, isolated places. Once you are in darkness, you are never safe from a terrorsleep.\n\nThere are surmises that the original beasts might have once been intended as riding animals or messengers, but were corrupted by horrific experiments or the negative energies of Roshamuul. In their company, the terrorsleep only tolerate creatures similar to themselves: the feversleeps who are burning hot and sweaty to the touch and who love cool water, are perhaps the offspring of the terrorsleep or a sibling creature from a nightmare having taken shape. The shy shiversleeps however are the rarest of the terrorsleep family; they like shallow, warm water and are very territorial, disappearing like mist through suddenly opening vortices into the protective darkness, and very little is known about them at all.",

        "description": "The thanatursus is one of the few nightmare-twisted creatures that could establish itself as a new species. These creatures, that once probably just were common bears, became dangerous predators of berserk-like frenzy. The thanatursus is a carnivore that doesn't even shun away from carrion. In the contrary: it's known that the deformed bears often drag their kills into lairs, where they rot for a while before they are eaten. It seems the thanatursus does so for a more practical reason though. Observations lead to the theory that a thanatursus does absorb certain traits and even physical characteristics from their eaten prey. This seems to be more intense, the more fresh the devoured creature is. The natural instinct of the bear-creature seems to be to hide the carrion away for a later date, but if a fight with a victim drags on and drains more energy and blood then usual, the thanatursus is more likely to feast on it immediately. This probably leads to it mostly absorbing traits from more formidable foes and become more and more powerful over time. An average, grown up thanatursus combines the power and appearance of a couple of their prey. Some of them develop horns, similar to bulls or stags, most display the snout of a boar or fangs of a wolf. Some added more disturbing elements like human-like hands, elf-like faces or the wings of a giant bat. Even scales and tentacles are possible additions to their body. While the common thanatursus is an enough disturbing sight and threat, their very nature makes vastly different and more powerful variants a possibility. Sadly it's more than just a rumour that some of these creatures escaped the dream realms and began to roam the realm of Tibia. Though loners, these individuals acquired considerable power and already changed into creatures vastly different from the common thanatursus. With men as part of their common diet, they developed intelligence and ambition, preying on more and more dangerous foes to add their strengths to their own array of abilities.",

It's not unheard of that a tremendous tyrant in frenzy completely forgets about his underlings and leaves them to their own devices.\nIf a tremendous tyrant loses it's light organ, his capabilities to communicate are severely hampered. The organ usually grows back in a few weeks, yet some superiors have little patience with such underlings and executions of tyrants wounded that way are quite common.\nThe tyrants are carnivorous and their behaviour suggests that they prey on the meat of strong opponents, often chasing away lesser minions to get their preferred meal.\nThese violent taskmasters communicate with each other through their light signals in a fast way and are able to coordinate the attacks of their packs in frightening manners. The meanest and most vicious of them are known as alpha packmasters.

As a result, a troll with a special status has to fight for its life and to survive many attempts of backstabbing or arranged accidents by its brethren. Of course, every Troll Champion abuses shamelessly his privileges in his tribe. Therefore, it is only natural that a Troll Champion has to constantly watch his back and stay as fit and well-equipped as he can manage. This again makes him one of the toughest fighters of the tribe that other trolls turn to when in danger. Troll Champions are usually the leaders of small raiding parties or the personal bodyguards of the equally abusive chieftains. They love to bully weaker trolls and are hardly encountered without some henchmen that they can bully around and sacrifice in battles.",

They are therefore rarely seen down in the mines, but rather at the ovens in, around and under the gingerbread palace. That's where their delicious creations are made.

        "description": "The tunnel tyrant is a creature that oddly resembles a creature in gnomish fairy tales. The beast of these tales is probably based on early encounters of gnomes with tunnel tyrant in a long forgotten past. This may hint that the tunnel tyrant might have been more common in areas closer to the surface but for what reason ever then vanished from the tracks of history for an untold time just to reappear in the recent invasions from below. Given the sheer numbers encountered, it's save to assume that the tunnel tyrant at least in our time isn't at the verge of extinction. Sadly enough they hold up to all the vicious and cruel things that the old tales attributed to them. It possesses a raw, bestial cunning and though not capable of speech like in the tales, they obviously posses some sort of intelligence. They often hold back in battle until they spot an opening or weakness and tend to let others do the dirty work and take the beating. They prefer fights where the odds are at their favour and like to ambush unsuspecting opponents. They rather wait for reinforcements than to attack on their own and often circle their opponent like a shark before ready to strike. In the armies of those below they somewhat lack the opportunity to act as cautious and cunning as they are used to but more often then not the causality rating of a battle is on their favour. In freedom the tunnel tyrant is a highly territorial creature that hunts in small packs that have their lairs in spacious caves. With their emergence in the armies of those bellow the tunnel tyrant can no longer be considered to be a rare creature of the depths but if there are a greater number of lager populations deeper down or if they are specifically bread for the armies, no one can tell. Their usual prey are bugs and cave spiders that stand no chance against them. Bolder packs occasionally raid the lairs of giant spiders and their brood, which seems to be a special treat for them. By all devious cunning they are not cowardly though. If they decided on a prey they will fight viciously with all their might to bring down even bigger and stronger opponents. ",

        "description": "The first turbulent elementals were originally sucked into Zarhanash by rifts and breaches in the lands of the living. As everything else they did not remain untouched by the realm, though. Usual drawing their power out of their natural element, they instead of fed on the rotten essence of Zarganash and quickly became more an element of despair than anything else. Through unfettered feeding on the vile energies of the realm, they quickly overcharge more and more and become unstable. At some point the element bursts into a veritable storm that breaches the realms and has the powers to suck in more elementals that might be drawn to the storm that occurs in their realm too. This is a highly dangerous process beyond their control, that more often than not leads to their own destruction and dispersion. Often their remainders are quickly devoured by other denizens of the realm, but sometimes they even manage to survive the process and reform. Given the number of existing turbulent elementals and the rarity of natural rifts that suck in new untainted elementals, it can be assumed, that the chances for a turbulent elemental to overcharge and cause a realm storm are somewhat common. With more active exploration of Zarganash by travellers, newest data might suggest that the number of turbulent elementals in a given area heavily influences to probability of an elemental to overcharge. If the elementals are numerous, the chances seem quite slim. If they are rare a realm storm seems very likely. The storms that they cause are dangerous in the realm of Zarganash as well as in the realm of the living. Only other turbulent elementals can roam then freely and even flourish in them. The passages between corresponding storms are random, short lived and follow the accompanying lightning patterns. So it's rather unlikely for a mortal to pass through, yet elementals that ride wind and lightning or an occasional soul are not uncommon to become unwilling travellers.",

        "description": "The Twisted Shapers are a testament to the tragedy which befell their ancestors. Even though they do no longer radiate their race's greatness of the past, the Twisted Shapers still have an instinctive talent for the abilities of their forefathers. Obviously more cunning and intelligent than the broken shapers, the Twisted Shapers almost seem like a different race. Still primitive and wild, they are the leaders and priests of their kind. They are the ones that preserve the remaining knowledge and everything else which is left of their civilisation - which is undoubtedly very little.\nThe uncompromising upbringing turned them into cruel creatures. Perhaps they have a vague grasp of what their people have lost as they seem to view the world with spite and contempt.\nThey seem to wield magic instinctively rather than to work real spellcraft. Just like a dragon who learns to breathe fire without thinking, the Twisted Shapers bend raw magic to their will and hurl it into their enemies. Most of their art is as twisted as they are themselves and their spell-like abilities rather destroy than create. Their destructive flashes are by far more powerful than their instinctive attempts to heal themselves or others.\nAlone the broken shapers view them as gods and follow their orders without hesitation. The Twisted Shapers lead the colony like some kind of sect. They seem to invent rules and rites on a whim or follow some unknown inspirations. One from their midst usually acts as their high priest or de facto king. This individual personally teaches and grooms the leader that will follow him one day. These two Twisted Shapers are considered to be the most important and prized possession of a colony. As such they are fiercely protected and timely evacuated if danger arises. If we believe recent records of adventurers, every encountered colony, no matter how far away, follows this pattern. This astonishing observation raises many questions and speculations. \nThere are records that a Twisted Shaper mother can give birth to a broken shaper child and vice versa. It is unknown though if twisted and broken shapers interbreed. This proves that the two species have not turned into entirely separate species yet, however, separation seems to be the way their race is ultimately heading to. Whereas the broken shaper children are left to fend for themselves, the Twisted Shaper offspring actually receives some kind of education by other Twisted Shapers.\nSome of the Twisted Shapers even seem to possess some ancient knowledge. They know how to operate at least parts of the artefacts left by their ancestors. Many of their rites, however, seem to have lost their purpose. The very few useful ones are used to operate objects such as gates, lights and other things of which the purpose is unknown to us. Even though, all they do is no more than a pointless mockery of their former greatness, the Twisted Shapers desperately hold on to it. Whenever they have to leave an area, the Twisted Shapers never forget about their home and constantly trying to retake it.",

        "description": "When the long forgotten ancestors of modern necromancers in dark caves sang their ritual chants, those ancient priests of death often rose one of the most fearsome beasts their race had to handle. They focused their powers to raise the mighty Undead Cavebear to unlife. This vicious beast was one of the masters that used to rule the mountains of old.\nIn unlife it is bent to the will of their summoners and spreads fear and death in the ranks of their enemies. An Undead Cavebear used to be not only a tool and minion, it was a symbol of status and leadership, not unlike a sceptre. Once an integral part of necromancy, the primal powers that aroused the Undead Cavebears from death have been forgotten and discarded in favour of more subtle magic that allowed more complicated creations.\nIn modern times the questionable honour of rediscovering the incantations belongs to ambitious researchers of the past. The bones they unburied and that belonged to powerful ancient necromantic priests were stolen and served as paraphernalia to summon ancient spirits and teach modern necromancers their arts. The raw and archaic enchantments quickly spread through the ranks of modern necromancers and so more and more Undead Cavebears are seen again as minions of death. As rumours go, the 'modern' Undead Cavebears are joined with some ancient constructs that somewhere withstood the ravages of time thanks to their robust nature and powerful enchantments.",

Just like some humans, also some dragons simply cannot let go though. Some of them acquire dark secrets in their long lives. Others forge dark pacts with necromancers and demons to rise again after death.\nIt is said that the first Undead Dragons were created by the malicious bonelords who are known to meddle with undeath and necromancy. Created as a weapon in some ancient war, the first Undead Dragons proved to be so powerful that they could not be controlled by their masters. They broke free of the bonelords' subterranean bone fencings and wreaked havoc on their own. The escaped Undead Dragons served as role models for other dragons who longed for this seeming immortality. Even though only a few dragons walked the shadow path that ultimately led to the embrace of unlife, those who did began to transform into even more powerful and threatening beings which finally developed to Undead Dragons. More similar to the lich than the usual undead, they have kept more of their former personality and knowledge than undeads of other races are able to. Their new powers make easily up for the loss of some of their dragon skills.",

Undead Gladiators can wield a large variety of weapons, and their undead state has even enhanced their fighting skills.

They strive for perfection, but ironically, their undead state prevents them from enhancing their skills further or to train their body. So the emptiness of their existence is haunting them every moment, and feeds the rage and jealousy towards the living.\nUndead Gladiators often participate in gruesome duels with each other to test their skills in a macabre and tireless dance of death, sometimes lasting for days.",

        "description": "This hunting Spider doesn't build intricate webs but in the past usually dug itself into the ground, to suddenly spring up, when alarmed through ground vibrations and drag their prey into their lairs. For these hunting tactics they earned the moniker 'Undertaker' by the first explorers to encounter them. \nWith the more active volcano and earthquakes their sense for prey has become widely disturbed and they have mostly left their hidden lairs to freely roam the lands in search of prey. \nIt has yet to be seen how this change of behaviour becomes their species as a whole and if its a viable tactic to survive. \nWhat can be said already, is that they became aggressive roaming predators that now are an even greater threat to all creatures in Gnomprona than before when their lairs could be spotted and avoided by keen senses. They are quite adapt at fighting which hints that their trap hunting habits were mostly a matter of convenience and less of necessity. Easily able to put up a fight, the Undertaker can  compete with the other gnomepronean creatures eye to eye. \nTheir underground lairs are not completely abandoned and they are still maintained. However, they now only serve as refuge, storage for excess prey or hiding spot for their eggs. Like squirrels, the Undertaker sometimes 'forgets' its current lair and builds a new one. \nDespite its hunting habits the undertaker still utilises some form of webbing which can be used spontaneously as a weapon. As the camouflage of the webbing that makes it look like a mixture of vines and roots has no apparent advantage, it's assumed that the undertaker in some distant past more heavily relied on local webs and its appearance as ordinary plant life, before moving to underground hunting lairs. This suggests that the undertaker is currently adapting for at least a third time to new behaviour patterns. This lets one wonder if this holds true for other gnompornean creatures, too or if such an adaptability is more something closely related to the undertaker per se.",

As undead, they are powerful vampires of a haunting beauty that own a respectable array of abilities. They love to play cat and mouse with their chosen victim, and are rather picky in their choice whose blood they are going to drink. Also those that are not worthy as a blood donor are not safe from death, though. Quite the opposite, Vampire Brides love to cruelly torture their victims to death.\nTheir cleverness makes many of them good magicians and alchemists. Some use magic or alchemy to look like a human and so make it easier to lay hands on their victims. They are vain creatures who love to surround themselves with small courts of undead in catacombs or under cities. It can take centuries before a Vampire Bride and its ghostly court are routed out by vampire hunters or the inquisition. Even then, the shrewd brides are often able to escape, ready to plan a horrible revenge.",

        "description": "The varnished diremaws are seemingly a special breed of diremaws. Several gnomish reports suggest that this strain of diremaws was created on purpose, as veritable farms of varnished diremaws were encountered by gnomish strike forces. Though there's no denying, that this breed is more formidable then their predecessor, it raises the question why Those Below with all the creatures at their disposal feel a need to specifically breed and groom this creature. It's also unknown who might be the mastermind behind such breeding, as most actions of Those Below are driven by a seemingly alien logic, the breeding of sub species seems an almost mundane trait to associate them with. Some theories suggest that the varnished diremaws have some hidden properties that are yet unknown. Some suggest they are possibly more easy to control or serve as the ideal nourishment of some bigger, meaner creature but such theories are highly speculative at best. Others point out that the taste of warm red blood drives them into a frenzy, but this seems a weak argument to justify such efforts. The assumption that the varnished diremaws can track every prey once they tasted its blood are based on no valid observations as there is no evidence that any diremaw was ever used in that way. Even if that would be the case such a trait wouldn't warrant the aforementioned efforts and number of bred tarnished diremaws. The only obvious fact is, that they are mixed into more and more hordes and bolster their ranks by significant numbers. There are no reported cases of packs that only consist tarnished diremaws. This might be a coincidence or another clue for a sinister, yet unknown purpose to those creatures.\nIn the hordes they seem to be one of the troops that are more easy to control and guide, though this means little, considering the sheer viciousness of the creatures the hordes consist of.\nWhile the tarnished diremaws are a foe only encountered more recently, their spread in the ranks of Those Below is increasing steadily and significantly.",

        "description": "The vexclaw belongs to a race that was once prized as personal bodyguards and strike force of many a demon prince. The size of its vexclaw retinue determined a prince's status and rank. It is said that this fact made the Vexclaws proud and lazy. After several vexclaw troops were bribed and switched sides in one of the many inter-demonic wars, the fame of the vexclaws quickly began to dwindle. In many courts,  leaders of the vexclaw guard were challenged, defeated and replaced; and the new leaders of the bodyguards sooner or later replaced most of the vexclaw forces with more capable ones. Since the vexclaws no longer were seen as status objects, their princes didn't care to object. So the vexclaws fell into obscurity for a while, shunned by other demons or even hunted for sport. At their lowest point, the vexclaws were expendable mercenaries of hell which were hired and used as it pleased the demonic warlords in their fights. Then something changed. When the demon prince Drazzak was imprisoned, his own dungeons were opened and his former prisoners released. One of them was Turaxor, whom his fellow vexclaws called the Sleeping Lord. This vexclaw was so ancient that he was rumoured to have witnessed the dawn of time. Immensely cruel and powerful, he was the trainer and mentor of all the most famous vexclaws of all times, those that once laid the foundation for the fame of their kind. He was so old that he frequently retreated and went into hibernation for centuries. In one of these hibernation phases, prince Drazzak seized the opportunity to drag the sleeping Turaxor into his dungeons, to use him as a leverage against the vexclaws as well as to stop a possible competitor for power. With the fall of Drazzak though, the still slumbering Turaxor was freed and hidden by loyal followers. When they managed to wake their lord, he was enraged. The downfall of his kind and the treachery of the prince kindled his anger. He decided to rebuild the glory of the vexclaws, beginning with a campaign of extermination of his own kind to cut off anything too weak to survive. He gathered the remaining vexclaws and led them through a series of fights, tests and hazards that only the best survived. Then he began to train and instruct them in the old ways. Step by step, Turaxor rebuilt the vexclaws that once were.  Many still have more of a mercenary mentality than pride, but things are changing. No longer are the vexclaws of no consequence, and again the princes begin to look at them with new found admiration. Some princes have already reintegrated some vexclaws into their bodyguard; and the resurgence of the vexclaws has just begun.",

        "description": "Zarganash's hostile environment gave birth to an own breed of phantoms that differs by the hazards that help to form them from the tormented souls they once were. Though in shape of little difference to other phantoms, the vibrant phantom in a spiritual sense is bloated, saturated and fat. It has absorbed many soul fragments and splinters and flourished in an unnatural way that is rare in Zarganash. But in the end the essence they devoured, bears the taint of Zarganash and unknown to themselves the vibrant soul is ultimately feasting on itself. This final atrocity, this ultimate trick, the deepest depth of the nether realm plays on them in the epitome of its perversion. Yet oblivious to their own nature the vibrant phantoms count them self to the winners in Zarganash and are at the top of the food chain. The many voices in their conscience are shoved away like annoying flies and the phantom enjoys its privilege and relative power. They actually interact with other vibrant phantoms and have built some form of community and even hierarchy. It's not uncommon for vibrant phantoms to band together in a common goal. In that way they are the most civilised of the phantoms, yet not less vile and aggressive towards outsiders. In their view Zarganash is their realm to rule and any opposition or intrusion has to be crushed without mercy. There are several 'courts' in which the vibrant phantoms indulge in the idea of hierarchy and greatness. They grant themselves imaginative titles of all sorts and even participate in royal hunts in which they hunt down randomly chosen victims. Sometimes they even take captives and hold mock trials in which they list al sort of transgressions against evenly made up rules. Such trials always end with the execution of the captive in a gruesome way. Still vibrant phantoms have one the highest levels of self-awareness of the damned and at least in theory a slight chance of redemption. Even though in the aeons that Zarganash exists not even a handful individuals are known to have attained such status, there are rumours abound and each vibrant phantom sees itself as the next candidate for greatness. Of the few that acquired that state, some found wisdom, others salvation or at least new power. The Dread Maiden is rumoured to have raised that way, but that's easy to say and next impossible to verify.",

        "description": "Lowlifes, bandits and cutthroats make up the bulk of the followers of the fallen knights and robber barons. With little regard for law and honour, these scrupulous beings follow profit, power and promises. Usually already on the run from some local law, they seek out the protection that the villainous knights offer them. They are the disposable muscle and arrow fodder their masters rely on for their crimes. They are equipped with the left-over scraps that their superiors don't mind about, and are easy prey for the whimsical justice of their dark lords. Still, they look down on the ordinary bandit and tend to justify their miserable existence by boasting of the accomplishments of their leaders, taking a perverted sort of pride in their services, and especially in the exploits of their leaders. This pride means nothing as soon as it is seriously tested, though. The so-called 'vicious squires' tend to flee from battle if there's not an immediate victory at hand; and should one of their superiors shows any sign of weakness, it is surely exploited in one way or another. Regardless of their similar behaviour to bandits, it has to be acknowledged that they are indeed better equipped, fed and prepared for battle than their ordinary brethren in spirit. To be accepted as a squire and survive more than a few weeks requires some battle prowess and cunning which only veteran bandits posses. Usually, a wandering robber knight assimilates the local bandit gangs in his troops. On rare occasions, a knight and his followers take over some remote settlement for a while and empty the prison to acquire new recruits. After a short time, only the suitable candidates are left over. These are more or less formally accepted as new squires and are under nominal protection and legislation of the knights. All in all, though, they are left to fend on their own as long as they follow orders. Usually, where the squires are encountered, their masters are not far away; but sometimes they are sent on long-range reconnaissance or have been abandoned by their leaders for some reason. After losing their leaders, they usually disperse quickly, mostly looking for another knight to follow, some founding their own bandit gangs, reverting to old customs. Sadly, it is not unheard of that roaming squires are allowed into official armies or city guards for their experience and training. For most of them, though, there are only a few options left open at the end of their dubious career. Most end their lives as squires in one of their masters' raids. A significant number falls prey to internal struggles for power and loot. A few gather some renown and are finally 'knighted' by their leader. It is not known that any of them have ever accumulated enough money to retire peacefully - then again, probably no one would boast of such a criminal past. ",

        "description": "From all the knights that have fallen, the grandmaster has fallen the lowest and hardest. Once an epitome of virtues and skill, they have turned away and sought out forbidden wisdom or power that they valued over their former ideals. Seduced by dark secrets and lust for power that no man was meant to wield, they no longer respect what was once dear to them. Still, they value order and hierarchies and gather followers that they can corrupt to their own ways. Formidable combatants and equipped with spoils of their former exploits, they can easily overpower challengers to their leadership; and as long as they can provide their underlings with a twisted purpose and loot, they rule like they  used to in their order. Sometimes they bow to a greater power, usually for the promise of even more power and knowledge. \nAll grandmasters were pious and spiritual men in their former lives. This does not change with their fall, though the focus of their devotion is what changes significantly. With fanaticism and zeal they pursue their new dark goals and accept a life that becomes a perversion of all that was once dear to them. \nThe new rites in which they indulge themselves are gruesome and cruel and stress their complete conversion from their past. Driven by new unholy desires, they use their followers to advance their new dark goals without restraint and mercy. Some still hold up some remote ideals of honour, but even that is often twisted and only concerns personal combat. In general, a grandmaster considers everyone as beneath his station, only making an exception for individuals of vast power. Although they are often associated with some kind of cult that promises them their desired secrets, in their hubris they don't get along too well with other cultists. Whenever possible, they try to take over the cult and rule  on their own. \nVile grandmasters are often bitter rivals of one another, which is especially true for members of different cults. But even when united in a specific cult, they usually get along only grudgingly. Often it takes a powerful cult leader to force different grandmasters to work together. With their skills and weaponry, enhanced through dark powers, the grandmasters are formidable foes indeed. Some of them have been brought back from the gates of death or even beyond so many times that they lost the last remains of their humanity. \nThere is no mercy to be expected from a vile grandmaster, and he will never yield in a fight. Any would-be challenger is advised to be prepared for the worst before engaging this enemy. ",

The attempts of the dwarfs to replace their digging rotworms with Vulcongras were met with little success due to the Vulcongras' untrainable nature. The Vulcongras are almost purely by its instincts. Their foremost need seems to be hunger. Vulcongras spend most of their time on finding and eating. Since they can eat almost everything from dust to stones, they are literally eating constantly without any need of sleep or water. As there seems to be no way to scare them off, Vulcongras often become a threat for gnomish holdings. As they do not seem to care what they eat, the Vulcongras shun away from nothing. They could equally destroy a gnomish house as they would devour precious tools or crystals. They stoically fight back any attackers. Even when not attacked, someone often finds himself at the centre of a Vulcongra's eating attention as it tries to sample some bites. They lack any evil intention,though. The gnomes are experimenting on driving them away with certain crystal frequencies or lights, without any notable success till now. The Vulcongra seem to be just too dumb to be affected by any scare tactic. The stupidity and hunger of the Vulcongra is so prominent that they feature in many gnomish sayings such as 'hungry as a Vulcongra'.",

By letting its opisthosoma vibrate, the spider creates a variety of sounds that are used to lure or stun its prey. In addition to other more 'spider-like' abilities, they use this sonic manipulation in a way that reminds frighteningly of intelligence and purpose. Although they can survive in some kind of hibernation for unknown periods of time, they are known to be ravenously hungry whenever the opportunity arises. Such devoured extra food is almost immediately used for reproduction, and when such a population increase used up all food sources, they proceed to cannibalism, which is mirrored in their moniker 'widow'.\nWith the decline of the lizard empire, also the regular extermination campaigns against spider nests were stopped. This and the population growth of their favourite prey, the lancer beetle, let the number of Wailing Widows steadily increase. Strangely enough, accompanied by their growth the once reclusive spiders became more and more bold, raiding settlements and attacking far greater prey than before. It is debated if they are influenced by the land's corruption itself, or by digesting the obviously corrupted lancer beetles. Whatever theory might be correct, in the end both mean that the Wailing Widows have turned into a considerable threat to explorers of unknown areas and also to some remote settlements.",

        "description": "The walkers were once simple glooth driven machines that required a skilful operator to be used as transports. They were another application of techniques learned in the creation of the glooth golems and similarly ill understood in their design principles. Yet they were by far more simple and reliable. This all changed when famous inventor Jaccus Maxxen returned from a years long travel through the world. The man that formerly was seen as shy and reclusive if not a bit strange returned as a changed man. People say a strange fire burnt in his eyes, a feverish shimmer that probably foreshadowed the things to come. He never spoke about the things he had seen or learned in his travels. All that he gave away were strange mocking comments about the futility of life and the things that foolish humanity had yet failed to grasp. In his first and last appearance before the conclave of scientists after his return he delivered a feverish speech so full of insults and hatred that he had to be removed after less than five minutes. He retreated into his laboratory never to be seen again. For months there was no contact with the outside world and by day and by night there was a constant noise of work and machinery. After a while the officials became more and more suspicious and sent a task force to bring Maxxen to the conclave. They went to his laboratory and demanded that he came out. After they got no answer they begun to pry the doors open, only to see them thrust wide open from inside. What emerged though was not Maxxen himself but a veritable army of riderless walkers that were augmented with additional weaponry. The machines broke through the city guards and left a trail of blood and destruction through the city before they parted and vanished out of the city. Maxxen himself was never found, only a bunch of burned notes remained from him. Some assume that he vanished in the chaos, using one of the walkers as a mount. Others claim the guards found certain gruesome evidence that suggested otherwise but they were forbidden to talk about. The Maxxen walkers are still encountered at different places, seemingly following some discernible agenda. Although they are ordered to be destroyed on sight even after years there is a considerable number of them around so that it is impossible that all remaining walkers are part of the first batch that escaped the laboratory. How and where new autonomous walkers are built is yet another riddle in the strange story of Jaccus Maxxen.",

        "description": "The Waspoids are the ever-busy scouts of the hive. They are highly responsive to the hive's wishes and can be found almost everywhere in the vicinity of the hive. As soon as a Waspoid encounters something tasty or threatening, it uses its powerful pheromones to call for reinforcements. So encountering a single Waspoid often means that all Hive Born in the area are on their way to assist the Waspoid in a few heartbeats. Therefore it should be killed as fast as possible. The Waspoid itself is, strangely enough, not truly aggressive. However, it displays a rude curiosity that involves stinging and biting of the encountered object which, despite its unaggressive intention, leads to a fight. The wings of the Waspoid are known to emit a highly annoying noise that can unnerve even the most stoic mammal. Insects, however, seem to be magically attracted by the noise and experiments seem to prove that the Waspoids are able to gain some kind of influence over insects that are not native to the hive. The experiments suggest that the Waspoids can control and lure foreign insects to the hive. Since it has been deemed as too dangerous to continue such experiments, they have been forbidden and it can only be speculated what the hive would 'do' to such formerly unaligned insects.\nIn the battle against the Deeplings, the Waspoids are harassing opponents from unexpected angles, circumventing battle lines. They are an advance force that pierces the enemy's defence to disrupt the supply lines and reinforcements. Waspoids rather operate in small groups on their own than joining forces with other Hive Born. This way they can fully exploit their speed and their flight ability and so gain a considerable advantage for their army.",

        "description": "Water buffaloes were once common inhabitants of swamps, but the large buffalo population proved to be an easy prey for the humanoid races. Against their long-ranged weapons, the slow buffaloes were defenceless. Hundreds of buffaloes were slaughtered notably during the construction of Venore. The vast buffalo population dwindled almost to the point of extinction, leaving only small packs. But what happened then is subject to speculation. The irrefutable facts are that from one day to the next, the remaining buffaloes simply had gone, vanished without a trace. Where just the day before buffaloes had been grazing, their footprints were found to end suddenly, as if they had disappeared into thin air. While this report was dismissed and the buffaloes simply thought extinct, all of a sudden they reappeared... in greater numbers and more healthy and aggressive than before. People began to form hunting parties to drive the aggressive animals away. But the hunt did not go too well and after a while, the buffaloes disappeared again, dissolving into rising mists, sometimes even right in front of the astonished hunters. Up to this day, there is no rational explanation for this occurrence. Again and again, the ghostly herds reappeared in numbers that belied the casualties they must have suffered during their last appearance. However, if a buffalo was killed, its body remained when the others vanished again and even if a buffalo had been befriended or tamed, it remained in the known world indefinitely. Still, there is no clue whereto the buffaloes vanish, and what happens there to them. The strange behaviour of the buffaloes has led to many superstitions and it is deemed  unwise to hunt buffaloes or eat their meat lest it should anger some unknown force. Some speculate that Crunor himself guards the buffaloes and grants them refuge in a mystical realm outside of space and time, while others believe the buffaloes learned some instinctive magic which provided them a magical shelter. Others again have theories about an extra-dimensional race abducting the buffaloes for experiments. In any case, someone seen riding a buffalo is regarded as either extremely brave, or extremely foolhardy as it is still considered possible that the buffalo, along with its rider, may some day vanish forever into an unknown world.",

It is all the more astonishing that in appearance and behaviour they could be confused with biological live forms. This raises a lot of questions about the Weepers and is fuel to dozens of more or less educated guesses about their origin. Some speculations see them as surviving servants of a long extinct race. Others point out the possibility that they are the offspring of early gnomish experiments. Some see the Weepers more in the array of elemental beings, going so far as to say that the Weepers are the incarnation of a new and to date undiscovered element. They got their name from the fiery 'tears' that usually leak in what would be considered their eye region as well as the odd sobbing sounds it emanates. Weepers are extremely unpredictable in their behaviour. The only constant seems to be their hatred for biological life which they attack fiercely and without restraint.",

In recent years under the protection of the elves, the population of the White Deer has recovered to a healthy base. Still the population is somewhat fragile and several local carnivorous animals, most prominently the wolves, have become dependent of the White Deer as prey. So despite elvish efforts, the deer are still endangered. Should too many of them meet an early demise, the population would have a hard time to recover, given all the predators of the woods.\nThe White Deer itself is a magnificent yet peaceful creature of grace and beauty. Its fur and antlers are valued by traders though it is somewhat difficult to find a trader that does not fear the elvish ire. In modern days, the deer has been mostly demystified. The assumption of great wisdom has been discarded and the myths about its magical abilities have been disproved. Neither can the deer change the weather nor can they turn invisible when in danger. The human view of 'just another type deer' has led to confrontations with elvish rangers who vigorously defend the deer from hunters. So despite the profitable loot, the hunting of White Deer has become the domain of a few unscrupulous or daring individuals that do not mind to clash with self-proclaimed elvish protectors.",

At the beginning, the transformation only takes place at full moon, and the victim regains its human appearance the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation lasts longer and the full moon is no longer a necessary condition for the transformation. At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.\nWeretigers are strong and tough, yet not too agile. They are dangerous predators and their appearance is a mix between a tiger and a human being. Like tigers, Weretigers favour warm jungles as homesteads and are territorial and aggressive.White Weretigers are rarer and stronger than their orange-coloured counterparts.\n\nThe curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.",

In their natural habitat there is rarely enough food to support more than a handful of Wiggler in any given area. So in the distant past the Wiggler must have been a rare sight. With gnomes cultivating mushroom gardens and sometimes even abandoning them for safety reasons, the Wiggler found enough nourishment to grow significantly in numbers. By the time the gnomes learned about the significance of the rising threat, it was too late to turn the tide. The Wiggler has become a common threat for gnomish holdings and is probably even more threatening to other underground dwellers who are ill prepared. Wigglers are usually found on gnomish mushroom fields. As they are killed, more seem to appear. All the gnomes can do is practise damage reduction by eliminating this threat in the vicinity of their holdings. Still success, if any, is usually short lived. Worse still, with all attempts to exterminate the Wigglers every new generation seems to become a little bit more resilient and more aggressive. Where in tales of old the Wigglers shunned away from light sources, in our days they seem to be drawn to them instead. If the old Wigglers fled when discovered, the new generations fight back fiercely. Though not an enormous threat if on their own, their numbers and sheer limitless reinforcements make them quite dangerous, especially as the newer breeds have shifted their strict mushroom diet to a more omnivorous one that does not shun the flesh of living beings.",

They have endured the trials of getting used to a physical body and gained a certain familiarity with it and the physical world. This enables them to uses their strengths to the full extent, and they have become considerably more dangerous. They usually are so accustomed to an certain environment that they become extremely territorial. Still, most of them understand only very basic concepts of our world and are inhabited by a consciousness that is extremely alien to that of a human. Most of these old golems share an inexplicable aggression towards lifeforms that are not plants. On the other hand, they seem to be able to communicate with plants in some way and are usually overly protective towards them. These factors combine to an extremely dangerous state of mind that often led to attacks on anything that enters their woods. Astonishingly enough, their attacks display not only an affinity to the element earth, but also to the element of air, as they instinctively use it to enhance their movement or more often to hinder that of their chosen foes.\nThere are rare cases of reports that tell about good-natured withered leaf golems. Almost all those cases can be linked to leaf golems inhabited by the spirits of former druids who have become more accustomed to their changed nature. These versions of the withered leaf golems often are considerably more powerful than their spirit brethren. Malignant versions of this amalgamations also exist. They often are loners that claim entire forests as their own and act as their self-proclaimed guardian, discouraging anyone to even enter the realm of their gruesome reign. ",

        "description": "In ancient times the mago-mechanic Worker Golems used to be a common sight in Yalahar. They made a major contribution to Yalahar's wealth and luxury, ensuring that at least the upper classes had not to worry about mundane tasks.\nThey are constructs made of a variety of magical artefacts. Moreover, Worker Golems own some sort of intelligence gained in a ritual not too different from the one which modern wizards use to create stone golems. With powerful runes and enchantments, some spirit have been called into the golems. Worker Golems are much more limited and specialised than other golems but they are also more precise and easier to control.\nThe Worker Golems came in many varieties, serving as construction machines, transporters, guards and butlers. In the course of the centuries, more and more of the Worker Golems malfunctioned and deteriorated. Nowadays, not many of the old golems are left. Although some cunning magicians figured out how to repair, control and even create such constructs, the processes involved are extremely time-consuming and expensive. For this reason, Worker Golems outside of Yalahar are a rather rare sight, and many of the still functioning ones are badly affected. Such Damaged Worker Golems are of course much weaker and less durable than the repaired and intact versions.\nThough the initial commands of the golems prevented that they attacked a Yalahari, this instructions seem not to be valid  for outsiders such as humans. This is probably caused by the fact that outsiders were very rare in the glorious past of the city, nonetheless, nowadays it poses a threat and often leads to fatal attacks. Of course, this is another point while Worker Golem are  hardly in usage nowadays.\nAlthough the Worker Golem has become rare over the centuries, there are still some old factories were an unsuspecting explorer might encounter some of these golems mindlessly doing some kind of work.  Worker Golems attack intruders with different built-in magic tools using them quite effectively as weapons.",

Although foremost prominent in the mentioned new founded kingdom the teachings of the great worm had a lure in several minotaur communities. Associated with freedom and renewal the cult is mostly disliked by officials and often forbidden. Such laws though sparked even more interest in the teaching that the rules deemed obviously to dangerous for their subjects to know. In reality most worm priests are individualists and self-proclaimed prophets that the great worm entrusted with special insights. There is no true unified church of the worm yet and even the few things that are considered basic teachings are up to interpretation. Most worm priests are highly skilled alchemists first, preachers second and always also accomplished magicians, often for some reasons defectors of the death cult. Most of their displayed miracles are product of their elixirs and salves, others are easily recognized as some basic magic. It's quite rare that worm priests work together. Whenever this occurs usually a very potent worm priest had unified them by force and guile and is pulling their strings. As a unified cult has yet to emerge, fights amongst worm priests and their followers against another sect of the cult are common and usually bloody. All sects regard Harraz, the first prophet of the worm as holy but even in the interpretation of the few of his passed down words there is no agreement. For now the cult is strongest in the clans of ZZZ where it originated. Since a triumvirate had been established as leadership it is in a good position to endure, but arguments in this inner circle makes progress slow and tedious. ",

Dragons, on the other hand, oppose this theory like a human would oppose the theory that an orc is a primitive relative of a human. In the end, the distinction is of no importance if you face such a creature. While it lacks the fire breath of a dragon, it is still a creature of heat that knows how to melt snow and ice while passing through it. What it lacks in magic, it makes up with sheer strength. It is a much better fighter than ordinary dragons and astonishingly agile, almost like a snake. A Wyrm's teeth are prized by dwarfs since they easily cut through most materials. The Wyrm indiscriminately eats minerals and meat alike, and it is said that you sometimes find valuable metals in the excrements in their lairs. The Wyrm is a powerful predator that does not back away from attacking small towns in times of hunger. Their territory is usually quite large, though they tend to stay in their lairs most of the time. Wyrms are quite intelligent compared to other animals. Still, they are not capable of speech and at best understand a few short commands just like a trained dog. Of course, training a Wyrm is easier said than done. However, there are some scrupulous beings that capture young Wyrms and train them for their evil plans.",

        "description": "Some scholars consider the Wyvern as a distant cousin of the dragons. This is far from truth though. The Wyvern we know nowadays are the result of constant breeding of some significantly smaller, only mildly poisonous flying lizards. Over several generations, orc shamans had selected the biggest and meanest of those little beasts for breeding. Subjecting those lizards to poison and alchemistic brewages as well as constant fighting, the orcs captured and killed thousands of them. Long before the breeding cycles came to an end, the original lizard race became extinct. Originally intended to be used as weapons in wars, Wyverns proved to be too uncontrollable and impulsive to be of any real use. Finally they were used for sports events in which the orcs forced them to battle each other and other creatures. So the breeding continued for a while until the orcish society was shattered by wars and many Wyverns escaped into freedom. These new and powerful predators had no problems to survive in freedom and only their natural aggressiveness, even among each other, prevented that they became a widespread plague.\nNowadays, the most aggressive Wyverns became extinct. The new breed is somewhat more sociable. Wyverns often form small packs, but since they are still quite aggressive, lethal power struggles are common, especially when it comes to leadership. Given their aggressive disposition, several Wyverns still end up in solitary.",

        "description": "It is hard to say when sightings of the Yielothax were first recorded. The creature seemed so bizarre and fantastic that encounters with them probably were dismissed as feverish illusions. That is when such an encounter was survived at all. It is safe to say that the Yielothax are not native to our world. They usually enter our world due to bizarre magical phenomenons, often the result of careless spell casting experiments. Sometimes dimensional travellers encounter them in what was perceived as their home dimension. Newer researches suggest that the Yielothax are an invasive life form that not unlike a swarm of locusts invades and occupies other dimensions or planes of existence while annihilating all native life. Since they change the environment in a certain way, it was often assumed that travellers meeting Yielothax in their 'native' habitat were visiting the same dimension. This was proven wrong by new scientific methods and insights, though. There are heated debates whether the Yielothax is more like carrion eaters, invading dimensions that have become weakened and fading, or if the Yielothax are the reason for the fading of those dimensions. Whatever theory might be true, it is a fact that dimensions in which the Yielothax are encountered in mass become more and more unstable and finally unreachable after a while. It is currently unknown if there is (still) such a thing as the Yielothax' home dimension at all. The Yielothax are very territorial and extremely aggressive to any non-Yielothax life forms. They can reach a surprising speed and attack rapidly, trying to rip their opponent apart. The Yielothax are omnivorous in the truest sense. They eat virtually anything. There are verified reports of Yielothax eating substances like rock, tar and even magic walls. Even if the Yielothax are probably sentient beings, they seem unwilling to communicate with any non-Yielothax life form. Since the rare cases of Yielothax sightings in our dimension are the forerunners of an impending invasion, everyone who encounters Yielothax in our realm is asked to report this to the scientific authorities immediately.",

Goannas lay eggs in a nest or burrow, but sometimes also inside termite mounds, which offers protection as well as incubation. Additionally, the termites provide a meal for the young as they hatch. Goanna eggs are a sought after meal for the human population of Kilmaresh. But as getting them is a dangerous task, they make a rather expensive menu. \n\nGoannas are found throughout the steppes of Kilmaresh. They prey on insects, smaller lizards, snakes, birds, mammals and also humans if they have the chance to do so. But they are also eaters of carrion and thus attracted to rotting meat. There's a debate whether goannas are venomous or not. It is a fact that goanna bites cause incessant bleeding and many sages assume that this is because of toxin-producing glands in the lizards' mouth.",

Amongst a flock of other hungry baby serpents, only the strongest survive the ferocious appetite of their siblings. While fighting for food with each other, they have to elude the occasional attacks of their uncaring parents. Quickly, the fight for survival becomes natural to the Young Sea Serpent. It's not such a surprise that Young Sea Serpents are aggressive and predatory. To reach the  immense size of an adult sea serpent, a Young Sea Serpent has to eat almost constantly. Always driven by hunger, they are often more daring and aggressive than adult serpents. Gladly they are too small to pose a threat to ships but they may attack small fisher boats.\n\nThey often follow fish schools to devour as much of them as they can. When doing so, it is not uncommon that they cross the path of a fisherman. Lucky are those who come out of such meetings with nothing worse than ruined nets. Often the ferocious attacks of the Young Sea Serpents capsize whole boats and the fishermen lose their catch and sometimes also their lives.\nGiven their appetite and the aggressiveness of their species towards each other,  it is not astonishing that Young Sea Serpents often are loners. In the rare cases they stick together, they have hatched from the same nest and have established a strict hacking order that is necessary to avoid bloodshed and cannibalism.",

If this happens, whole towns are overrun by transformed Zombies that later haunt the surrounding area for months, or even years. For such incidents, all potential zombie masters are chased by the inquisition. In some years, the popularity to burn suspicious alchemists even outstripped the popularity of witch trials.",
