        "notes": "The forest furies are the tragic product of careless experiments with the waters of Ashar'tel. Inspired by the rebellious amazons of Carlin, some young and restless elven maiden founded a sisterhood of their own. The futility of their protest against the rigid elven society and it's rule soon drove them to foolhardy dangerous ways of protest that bordered on criminal acts and endangered them of becoming outcasts. In an desperate attempt to hold her sisterhood together, their leader Emana Greenskull staged the theft of several amphora with the waters of Ashar'tel, branding the sisterhood as outcasts and binding her followers to her by taking from them the option to peacefully return to the society. With little knowledge about the water, but convinced it contained power, the elders refused the younger ones, Emana and her sisters inhibited themselves with the water. At first they truly felt the surge of power that they expected. But the water became like a drug the them and slowly changed their very nature and mutated them into something else. Convinced that the voices they heard in their inhibition were revelation from nature itself, the sisters embraced their change and even enforced it. The change though left them mutated not only in body but also in mind and after the last water has been used up, and symptoms of withdrawal begun to torture them, the remaining sisters were completely driven into madness. Renaming themselves as forest furies they see themselves as the chosen of nature and enacting it's revenge on the people misusing it - which is, in their twisted thinking, almost everyone bit themselves and a few allies. The furies are unpredictable but hatefully. They can not be reasoned with and the best one can hope for is, that they might be that absorbed in some holy mission, that they might simply ignore them. In battle the furies employ not only the physical force of their changed bodies, but also a variety of druidic spells, which are strangely enough often intuitive abilities, rather then spells and are unknown to other users of druidic magic.",

The first encounter of them probably took place not in their own realm but on Tibia. Just recently some older reports about an attack on a caravan could be connected to them. In the reports of the few survivors the caravan in question was attacked by a roaming orcish tribe. When all seemed lost, the orcs where attacked by what they would later call elf-like 'bow-furies'. At first the traders and their mercenaries were happy about their unsuspected rescue until they recognized their 'saviors' made no difference between men or orc, shooting and hacking their bloody path through them. At least the ferocious attack gave some of them the opportunity to escape with their bare lives at least. When the survivors later returned to the battle-site with reinforcements they found everyone slaughtered, not even the horses and pack-animals were spared but nothing of the goods were plundered at all.",

        "notes": "The dream-born are a reclusive race of creatures that are shrouded in mystery. Only recent events led to a contact that shed some light on these peculiar beings. There seem to be two distinctively different kinds of dream-born, that align themselves with either the winter or the summer. Though there are conflicting reports about that alignment, the current theory is that there are two rivaling courts exists though it's still possible that there is just one court that changes in accordance to the seasons. In the few recorded encounters, the dream-born claimed to live in realms that their god created with his dreams. Given their obvious kinship to the common elves it's of course far more likely that they are just descendants of elves that fled the godwars into some kind of pocket dimension. They usually shun outsiders and rarely leave their own realm at all. What little information could be gathered about them suggests a lifestyle akin that of the other elves, though they seem to lack a cast system and have a feudal oriented society. Due to their isolation they developed odd quirks like the overemphasising of seasons, that hints at a primitive, animistic world-view. It's still recommended to improve any contact and further the knowledge about them for the sake of science. All research of their behalves is hampered by what some kind of disease that drives them mad and violent. The dream-born claim that this is caused by 'nightmares' which may hint that a feverish episode is the precursor of this madness. Although this disease seemingly does not spread to other species, it is still recommended to keep these aggressive lunatics at distance. This behavior gives new credit to the old saying: If bitten by an elf, please see your doctor.\nOf all the dream-born who fell prey to the nightmare, the sirens of the winter court retain the most of their original intelligence, abilities and beauty. All the more they are by far the most dangerous of them. Seemingly having accepted their nightmarish visions as reality, they indulge into their madness and become scions of carnage and pain. The only pleasure they know seems to come from the destruction of all that was dear to them in their former lives. Their eerie form of insanity bestows them with a certain aura that even their maddened kin can perceive and that commands their respect. It's a fearsome sight when they command a horde of ravening mad ones with a slight gesture of a finger into a frenzied attack only to join them screaming and slashing within a heartbeat.",
