        "notes": "Another phenomenon attributed to the infamous necromantic smog of Rathleton is the existence of the blood beast. As hideous and disgusting as these creatures are, the secret of their creation is even more disturbing. It seems sometimes decaying corpses of animals become that imbued with the unstable necromantic residue, that their carrion blood becomes the carrier of some dark force when it somehow reacts with glooth. This blood behaves almost as sentient. It is known to creep around and even hide itself. It's searching for more blood, changed like itself and through metaphysical means is obviously able to sense it. Over time more and more of this mix of blood and glooth finds together, building sometimes enormous pools in underground caverns. Those pools act like a beacon for the spirits of predatory animals that died in pain and anger. If such a creature comes close to the pool a part of it splits and devours the spirit, becoming a separate entity on its own. The so created creature knows only the basest and cruellest instincts of the beasts. With a malleable body of soiled glooth and unclean blood it follows the needs of a predator. The blood beast lurks or hunts like ordinary animals would do, but it reveals a cunning beyond that of animals and a cruelty that is frightening. It is unknown if the creature actually needs food or at least has to replenish blood by its kills. The blood beast was immortalised by Hainnbert Shuckletons novel 'The beast from the shadows' which spread knowledge of these creatures throughout the world and painted a mostly false and overly romantic and tragic picture of the cruel predator. Rumours attribute the blood beast all kinds of unverified abilities like flowing beneath doors or through wall cracks or wall crawling and even lurking on ceilings. Most of this misleading information is spread by novels that tried to copy Shuckletons success and lead to the demise of more than one know-it-all adventurer. To complicate things even furthers there actually IS evidence to support some of the wilder claims made about the abilities of the creature. For instance it is extremely probable that the blood beast can reform itself after being slain. If it is via sentient blood creeping all their way to its spawning pool to be reborn or somehow else, there is proof that victorious blood beast slayers was attacked at his home, often in sleep by a blood beast that showed disturbing knowledge of its victims combat tactics. The gravest danger though is to dismiss the existence of these creatures as purely fiction and be utterly unprepared to encounter one.",

Whenever someone dies in the bogs, he is often in great fear or desperation. In many cases, these fears tie the spirit to the world of the living. Trapped between the worlds, these spirits become more and more desperate. They contaminate the environment by spreading their fear and desperation, and they bind rotten plants to the bones of their mortal remains. After several years, the spirit combines with its newly formed body and a new creature is born - a dreadful Bog Raider rises from the swamps. The new body consists of the skeleton that belonged to the living being the spirit used to be, wrapped round with masses of rotten plants, leaves and vines.Still driven by fear and often completely mad, Bog Raiders walk the swamps. However, their mad and frightening wailing warns all creatures of their approach. Hungry for life, Bog Raiders attack every living being that crosses their way, vainly trying to gain their enemy's life force to satisfy their tormenting hunger. Bog Raiders are rather driven by madness than by intelligence which makes them to dangerous enemies. However, there are also reports of Bog Raiders who overcame their madness and actually help nearby settlements or look after their former families from a distance.",

You can attempt them at level 55, skills 75/75. To really profit you would need better skills to kill them faster. Strange as it sounds, a Garlic Necklace is a better choice than Silver Amulet, as it blocks a large amount of their strong life drain and will last longer, while Silver Amulet will wear off really fast due to the fact you're always poisoned when fighting them. Be careful if you run into 4+ of them as they can combo pretty hard. Do not forget to use Berserk and Fierce Berserk in these situations. Paladins: Run and kill it as fast as possible with a strong distance weapon (Enchanted Spears, Assassin Stars or Power Bolts) to avoid running in another spawn. Level 50+ and skill 75+ is recommended. They are weak to physical damage, so Ethereal Spear may work better than Divine Missile, depending on your skills and level.",

The environment of Zarganash, with is the complete antithesis to life, health and growth, immediately begins to twist and corrupt those spirits in body and mind. With alarming speed it moulds them into something far more sinister and dangerous. In a mockery of their former existence, they foster the growth of bleakness and of all things that carry the deathly taint of Zarganash. In a vague memory of their former existence they find purpose in a twisted form of the things that were once dear to them. Where they once fostered growth, they now shepherd the lost souls towards their inevitable doom and damnation. They do so without glee, though. For them they are just following a new found natural order that all things have to bow to. Where other creatures of Zarganash seem to enjoy the suffering and abandonment of hope, the branchy crawlers seemingly just gave in to their new existence with an overwhelming resignation that virtually begins to seep out of them. Though they might even be able to feel some form of pity towards their victims, they still show no remorse or restraint. If anything, they seem to experience overwhelming self-loathing. They carry with them blight and despair, eternally locking them out of everything that could have had any deeper meaning to them. They are barred of anything they once held dear. In yet another mockery of their former existence the branchy crawlers have odd regenerative abilities. Whenever they are destroyed their essence will reform into a new branchy crawler after a while. This form of immortality is yet only a curse to them, binding them eternally to the twisted form and existence that they hate.

The devourer is an extraordinary example of such principles. It is living machine of teeth and muscle, ready to chew and devour everything in its path. The sheer appetite of the devourer seems absurd to a level that borders magical abilities. Dwarfs claim, that devourers were observed that devoured piles of rocks, five times of more mass then themselves, without changing size of mass on their own. This lead to over the top tales of dwarfish explorers that assume that the individual devourers are just remote parts of a bigger organism that is magically connected to them and feeding on all that his remote maws devour. Wherever these stories came from, they have spread through the dwarfen troops and handled as common knowledge. There is yet no scientific evidence of such claims and attempts to capture a devourer only lead to the entrapped devourer turning it inside out, devouring itself, so to say and dying. Devourers diet seems to contain of everything. When left alone they devour minerals, though they don't tend to burrow tunnels while eating and rely instead on loose rocks. Given their appetite, it's remarkable, that they actually can concentrate on battle when needed and put their hunger aside for a while. When the battle is done though they scour the battlefield for corpses and everything that is too wounded to fight back. The dwarfs that fought them the most have another tale about them, claiming the devourers developed a special taste for rust and seem to see it as a delicacy. \nThe devourers eternal hunger seems to rule all their actions so they know no fear or mercy in battle. They are constantly biting and gnawing, and almost enthusiastically employ this in battle to mangle their enemies.",

        "notes": "The cloaks of terror are the remnants of demons that entered the realm of Zarganash just to be devoured and ripped to pieces by its inhabitants. Their demonic residue slowly remained trapped in the realm and over time mixed and fused with other soul fragments, ultimately forming a new, vile construct that once again roamed Zarganash as mindless force of hunger and destruction. The cloaks are predatory and mostly instinct driven beings that prey exclusively on the living. When no living being is present they roam wide areas in their mostly futile hunt for prey. Eventually they slow down considerably and fall into dormancy after some time. While dormant they meld into the environment and are almost undetectable. Their overall composition makes them an undesirable prey for other denizens of Zarganash and so they can spent their time in dormancy relatively save. How long it takes to let them slip into such a state is widely different and probably dependent on several factors. Yet it seems common that they gather at some spots before going into dormancy. If a living being, in theory a rare occurrence in Zarganash, enters their presence, they wake up almost simultaneously which is a truly terrifying sight. A mass of silent levitating bodies that floats towards their target is enough to shake even the bravest warrior. Even worse though they emit a sound, that only dogs and certain other animals are seemingly able to hear, but that is nonetheless unsettling and even frightening to most humanoid beings. Their life detection has a fair amount of range and is seemingly shared with other cloaks in an area. Whenever one of them is able to sense life, all others will know and act on it. Their waking up is almost immediately and they waste no time before heading towards their prey. They show a great amount of violence and cruelty in their attacks, yet they seem in no way or form to devour any matter or energy of their targets. So it is even more astonishing what draws them to the living specifically and why they attack them with such ferocity. Why a creature in the land of the dead should so heavily specialise on the living is yet another insidious trick that the realm seems to play on intruders. No cloak of terror has yet been unleashed upon the realm of the living. It can be hoped that it's very nature is so heavily bound to Zarganash, that the cloaks are unable to pass the shroud between realms. Cloaks of Terror are the creatures from Furious Crater that can trigger Goshnar's Taints.",

It is assumed that some life form brought it here from the demons' realm of existence. Still, just like the common slimes, it shares the love for humid places of decay and darkness and like its smaller variant it does not care about living or dead as long as it is organic when it comes to eating habits. When the slime is seen as a symbol of poison and decay, those characteristics cannot be overlooked in the Defiler. Its relation to poison and decay also becomes evident in its attributes. A choking stench surrounds the Defiler and it can shoot some parts of itself to infect its victims with poison and decay. Its body turns into a poison field after rotting. Somewhat related to Slime. The Defiler's bosses are The Plasmother - located in Verminor's Throneroom - and The Abomination.",

        "notes": "The source of the devourers are slime creatures of unknown origin that over the cause of generation have soaked that much glooth residue that they became something new. The driving force of these creatures is an insatiable hunger and their digestion relies on incredible strong fluids. In the past the tiny ancestors of the devourers were used in Rathleton in waste disposal and they were deliberately allowed to roam the sewer system. First incidents with the nearly mindless creatures brought the officials to rethink that strategy. But it was already too late to stop the spread of the devourers. Even worse several extermination campaigns lead to an increased survival of the fittest evolution of the devourers and in few generations the slime creatures had doubled in size and fierceness. As a cannibalistic species they begun to further their own evolution by eradicating the weak and sick which lead to further selection. Some scientists speculate that the devourers are still evolving with each generation and that they will eventually grow even further with no limits. There are rumours about devourers that fused together is fearsome fights and continued as even larger and more dangerous versions of themselves. Even more alarming is the fact that the devourers are seemingly no longer dependent on glooth residue as they have not only spread outside of Rathleton but newly hatched devourers have travelled as blind passengers on ships and in cargo to different places and created new colonies. Wherever devourers are encountered officials are eager to exterminate the threat to prevent them from gaining a hold in populated areas. Devourers are not picky in their diet. Their powerful digestion system enables them to dissolve almost everything and they seemingly know no fear or pain. For some reason they prefer living food over dead matter nd attack most beings without hesitation. Since they have some kind of preference chain they will ignore anything else if they deem something as 'tasty'. As it seems, humans are considered as incredibly tasty by their primitive instincts. Devourers are considered as extremely dangerous and the words 'run, the devourer comes' has become a common phrases in plagued areas. Given his resilient nature and omnivorous appetite only caution has yet prevented further spread of the vile creatures but it's sadly just a matter of time when this threat to everything becomes commonplace.",

Due to its timer/cooldown mechanic, you cannot have 100% uptime of it, so it's important to beware when it's about to disappear as all creatures will change target. Since it's main function is to act like a blocker, it's not recommended to use it when hunting with a Knight as it will Challenge the creatures away from him, reducing the knight's damage output. Learning how to manage the summon can be tricky at first, as you cannot force it to cast its challenge spell. You should be prepared to block the creatures you're going to fight for a few turns until the Druid Familiar challenges them, since its spell use is quite erratic. Similarly, it's possible that it doesn't use the spell for a few seconds, allowing the creatures to retarget. An important strategy when using the Druid Familiar to block several creatures is to always change your target to the creature that will die last, because if the Druid Familiar doesn't have a target it will run back to its master, bringing the creatures its blocking with it. At higher levels, the Druid Familiar is used mostly in emergencies to Challenge creatures that are trapping another player or yourself. This however isn't always effective as the summon dies very quickly to strong creatures and may not even use the Challenge spell before that.",

        "notes": "The glooth anemone is a strange plant creature that is considered a parasite. The thing is, that this parasite is actually by far bigger then it's hosts. The glooth anemone mimics the harmless plant, also known as glooth anemone. The latter is a major food source and habitat for the gloothworms which are essential for Rathleton's economy. The glooth anemone creature in able to deceive the gloothworms into accepting it as a host and then devours the glooth that their produce. Not does it devour more glooth then the tiny worms can spare without perishing, the glooth anemone also somehow forces the gloothworms to produce excessive amounts of glooth, which often drains them to death even before they can die through glooth starvation. Due to this destructive nature the glooth anemone had to cope with the extermination of it food source that it causes in it's own. The glooth anemone copes with that problem by being mobile. Their mobility has brought up speculations that it's rather a creature, posing as lant then a creature that evolved from the harmless and docile glooth anemone to a predatory parasite. While in the past the glooth anemone was a minor nuisance, the glooth-production and domestication of gloothworms multiplied it's food sources almost over night. This lead to an alarming increase of the glooth anemone population and they became a threat for Rathleton. Several extermination campaigns, more started to protect the glooth then the population, helped to keep the glooth anemone population somewhat at bay, but recently it was discovered that glooth anemones have adapted to other glooth sources like the spoiled glooth that often is flushed into the sewers but they also capable of digesting glooth products over time. This means that the glooth anemone can be encountered almost everywhere which in addition to their mimicry makes dedicated hunts on them extremely difficult. When not posing as a harmless plant the glooth anemone is extremely protective of its food sources. It is known that glooth anemones are able to absorb organic material like flesh too but it's entirely unknown if that could sustain the creature in the absence of glooth.",

On the other hand, you find demonic entities that want to spread havoc in the world of the living. Both forms are actually spirits that have entered dead or living trees.Haunted treelings attack every living creature on sight, either out of spite or to seek revenge. It is likely that a man and a minotaur look alike for Haunted Treeling and that so one race has to suffer for the mistakes of the other. In rare cases it is possible to calm the nature spirits if showing respect for nature, the demonic form, however, can at best be bribed to stop attacking. Some woodland communities  have developed some form of coexistence with both forms. Other villages live in fear of these malicious creatures.Haunted Treelings can easily be mistaken for normal trees which makes it easy for them to ambush their enemies. Slaying their tree form will only result in chasing the spirit out of its wooden host, but actually does not harm it at all. They are exceptionally strong and know neither pain nor fear.",

Sometimes the spirits create the golems on their own, to act as a vehicle or tool to interact with the physical world. More often tough Leaf Golems are spirits that have been bound into such constructs by some druidic power. Mighty druids often employ the help of leaf golems spontaneously. They are created on the fly and often are discarded when a task has been performed. such discarded golems often disassemble on their own and the spirit is set free, sometimes they decide to roam the world on their own. Leave Golems are intelligent, but their thinking is based on the spiritual world and completely alien to the denizens of the physical world. Therefore it is impossible to communicate with them in any form. As spirits they seem to care little for the integrity of a physical body and they often seek to destroy living beings, presumably to set their seemingly entrapped spirit free. Even if they might mean no true harm, their attacks are threatening and lethal nonetheless.The leaf golem is a random and undecided fighter, oblivious to what might be most effective in a given situation. On the other hand it knows little fear and does not truly understand how to stay out of harms way.Sometimes druids that feel their live force wanning and their end near, choose to transfer their spirits into a prepared Leaf Golem. This golems are considerably more powerful but it is said that the inhabiting druid will eventually loose his grasp on the physical world and become a nature spirit on it's own.",

At level 60 you should take care not to be attacked by more than one mob at a time and heal often.\nAnother strategy is to burn the ground with runes and run (in circles) away from your summon which is followed by the Carnisylvans.",

        "notes": "The Omnivora is a strange offshoot of the Carniphila plant. This strain had an especially short life cycle, which allowed it to react rapidly to changes due to the fast production of new generations. It is assumed that some of those Carniphilas adapted to a more mountainous terrain, and settled in deep and dark valleys. Finding less soil and relying more on their carnivorous nature, they slowly compensated the lack of minerals through an enhanced digestion system which allowed them to consume bones and stones that the ordinary Carniphila would leave over. Less dependent on sunlight, the ancestors of the Omnivora found their way into the eternal darkness of subterranean areas. This they found to be a new habitat they were ideally suited for. The Omnivora quickly spread via tunnels and underground streams which carried their seeds. Only the fierce predators of the underground, who found the Omnivora a delicacy, stopped the population from exploding. Over time, the Omnivora adapted itself again and became highly toxic and inedible, but also less fertile. This led to a more stable population, but also to the Omnivora becoming the predator instead of the prey. The plants had developed highly acidic fluids to support their digestion of minerals, and newer generations employed these acids as weapons. Additionally, the plant used a surplus of certain minerals to build thorns around its blossom which acted as teeth. This led to a new cannibalistic behaviour, though. While Carniphila seedlings usually grow in immobile patches, the Omnivora, though featuring a similar reproduction pattern, as a seedling soon begins to attack other nearby seedlings; and this is repeated as soon as its growth allows it to reach the next seedling. Such infights usually continue until only one Omnivora seedling is left. Being a plant, it does not too well in too cold or too dry habitats, but apart from that the Omnivora's adaptable nature makes it possible to encounter it almost everywhere. Rather than looking for some additional sunlight like its Carniphila cousin, the Omnivora shuns direct sunlight, and usually settles in underground areas. Since they are particularly fond of the minerals provided by creatures turned into stone, Omnivoras seek out the proximity of creatures like Medusae if possible. The Medusae in turn seem to accept the Omnivora as some kind of decoration or pets in their lairs, unless they feel that the Omnivora is a pest destroying their 'artwork'. Some people warn that the development of the Omnivora species is not over yet, and that we might see an even more dangerous and aggressive breed in a few generations.",

        "notes": "The so called rot elemental is of course out of the scale of normal elemental classification. Though it shares several attributes with other elementals, it lacks other distinctive features and instead has in those areas more in common with spirits or even the undead. As a matter of fact, the existence of rot elementals is another phenomenon, connected to the necromantic smog of the Rathleton area but it could be encountered at other sites that were soaked with necromantic energy at one time. Actually the ghostlands and the plains of havoc are places that have seen at least manifestations of such creatures although up to today none of them endured for a longer time. So there are obviously other facts at work in the creation and stabilization of rot elementals. As far as modern science knows, the elementals are created at sites with a considerably number of waste and carrion. This fact is disputed by the theory that the manifestation just seeks out the greatest concentration of such matter rather than needing a certain amount of it. Be it as it may, some kind of spirit is drawn to such places and makes itself felt by and overwhelming presence of decay. Mould grows extremely fast and matter decomposes in exceedingly fast rates. It's like the spirits presence would dissolve suitable matter to use it for the creation of a host body. Several tests indicate that the spirit does not really inhabit this body but rather 'rides' it, in some way using it like a puppet. The controlling spirit seems quite primordial and not a specific spirit of a person or entity. It is more a certain instinctive consciousness that seems to inhabit certain necromantic fields and that is sometimes bound by necromants to inhabit and animate dead bodies. In the case of the rot elemental this consciousness is acting on its own. This it why it's called a rot elemental at all, it manifests spontaneously, has a certain consciousness on its own and is built of a specific 'element'. As the elemental classification, despite certain efforts, does not count necromancy or rot as elemental power and the purity of rot can't be measured as well as the presence of at least some considerable part of fluid, that would be counted as another element, is present, it seemingly defies too many rules to be scientifically counted as elemental. Of course the provisionally nomenclature as spontaneous necromantic physical manifestation was never popular enough so that the name rot elemental stuck to the creature anyway. As for its behaviour, it's considered as mindlessly malignant as its only driving motive seems to be to spread death and pain without any greater plan. Sometimes rot elementals are controlled via variants of spells that are meant to control the undead, but even such altered spells are of high risk and the elementals are known to break free in a frenzy.",

        "notes": "Though technically actual golems, there seems to be no creator connected to them. Now and then the golems could be observed appearing from seemingly nothingness. They show an intelligent design but seem to lack a specific purpose. The unknown creator, if existent at all, has yet to be identified. Some speculate this creator might be some avatar of rot and decay, somehow connected to the feared pale worm, that is still stuck in its infancy. The rotten golems are seen as the first, mostly purposeless actions of this enigmatic entity. Given their destructive and malignant nature this does not bode well for the nature of its nascent creator. The golems roam certain areas of Zarganash which are ripe with rot and decay, providing an ample and fertile ground for their creation. Their behaviour is aggressive and malignant, yet more sustained by a curious cruelty than any direct malevolence. While only spotted rarely in the past, sightings of rotten golems have become more and more common recently, though their appearance seems to be limited to certain areas that they prefer. A greater spread of the rotten golems is nothing to dismissed though, given that there seems to be an increase of their activity in general.\nFor now they seem confined to certain areas, where they attack intruders with almost childish excitement. When not facing an enemy they seem to relish in random destruction of environment that also has similarity to a curious playing child. It's not rare that they hurt each other or themselves in such a process. This never leads to infights, however, as the others simply join the destructive play. Despite not actually fighting they still might tear each other apart out of sheer curiosity. All this lead to speculation that the rotten golems might mature over time and gain greater consciousness and intelligence. But in over 200 years from the first reports of rotten golems, such specimens have not been observed. It only drops a Bag You Desire for players with at least one of Goshnar's Taints. The more taints you have, the higher the chance. The Bag is always dropped inside a Reward Container so there's no risk of leaving it behind in the creature's corpse.",

Outsiders however are immediately attacked with poisonous thorns that the nettle spits from a sack beneath its blossoms. It seems it has an endless supply of thorns and we have not heard yet of a nettle that has run out of them. It is not quite clear why a plant would attack in such a manner, but most likely it is some sort of self-defence that is unparalleled in the plant world. The lizard people have cultivated that plant to defend their dwellings. So utmost caution is advised when you encounter a colony of those plants, some angry 'gardener' could be just around the corner. They can attack you from a long distance even before you can see them on your screen!Some spawns are behind walls or plants, so you cannot reach them to attack with melee. In these cases, you need to use distance attacks to kill them.",

        "notes": "The stalking stalks are more of a carrion exploiter by planting their seeds into fertile corpses. And they don't shun away from creating such corpses by physical force at all.With quite an arsenal of natural weaponry they actively attack when they are 'fertile'. While out of seeds to spread, the stalking stalks become inert and hide in the thickets by perfect mimicry, becoming inanimate and appearing as a perfect copy of a number of other plants common in Gnomprona. This ability has fascinated scientists as the stalking stalk seems not limited to one form to shift into. There are experiments in progress that try to find out how exactly this ability works and how the limits are defined. Specific stalks seem to be limited to a set amount of other plants to mimic, though those might vary from stalk to stalk. To entice the stalks to shift into any plant which is not native to Gnomprona have not yet met any success at all.Their resilient seeds are even more dangerous to the carrion eaters of Gnomprona. The seeds often resist most digestive tracts of the local creatures, but more often than not begin to sprout while still in the stomachs of such creatures. The blooming stalk takes root in the intestines of it's victim and begins to grow util it finally kills it's carrier and a new stalking stalk bursts out. The dependence on such hosts leads to another odd characteristic of its sprout, as it closely resembles that of other, harmless plants, likely to entice other creatures to eat them and become their new host, as they are able to regress their essence back into a new seed to sprout again. It's easy to assume but next to impossible to proof the shared heritage of the stalks with other known animated plants that are way more common on the surface world and it's debatable if such plants lost some of the stalking stalks abilities in more fertile areas or if the stalks evolved separately and developed such features only 'recently' to cope with Gnomprona's hostile environment.",

        "notes": "The Swamplings are probably somehow related to the haunted treelings that appear in the realm of the living only on special occasions. They are a mixture of plant and animal and are at least partially intelligent. Though it will not react to attempts of communication in any other way than by attacking, it is considered to be an established fact that the Swampling has some ability to react and plan ahead in ways unknown to most animals. Swamplings are known to build simple traps, set ambushes and to make use of the surroundings to kill their prey. Though it seems that Swamplings can live on water and fertile soil for indefinite periods of time, they prefer to spice up their diet with the corpses of once living beings. The Swamplings seem to prefer intelligent beings to mere animals as their prey. It is assumed that the cause for this is not necessity, but rather the Swampling's evil nature.The Swampling population in the known world has survived many attempts to purge them from certain areas or from existence as a whole by the sentient races. Even the most successful attempts have only managed to drive them back for a while though. It has to be assumed that the Swampling seeds take incredibly long to grow and lie dormant for years before they begin to sprout. Some theories assume they might mimic other plants in their growth phase until maturity and then rapidly change into their known and mobile form. There are at least no reports of Swampling saplings ever having been encountered. The Swamplings usually prefer humid areas with fertile soil but sometimes, small colonies can be found in otherwise unsuitable areas where they can prey upon intelligent beings or do them some kind of harm. Ancient reports from Darama tell about remote oases that were plagued by Swamplings who lay in wait for weakened travellers and even poisoned the water supply to ensure the demise of their victims.",

They have endured the trials of getting used to a physical body and gained a certain familiarity with it and the physical world. This enables them to uses their strengths to the full extent and they have become considerably more dangerous. They usually are that accustomed to an certain environment, that they become extremely territorial. Still most of them understand only very basic concepts of our world and are inhabited by a consciousness that is extremely alien to that of a human. Most of these old golems share an unexplainable aggression towards lifeforms that are not plants. On the other hand they seem to be able to communicate with plants in some way and are usually overly protective towards them. This factors combine to an extremely dangerous state of mind that lead often to attacks on anything that enters their woods. Astonishingly enough their attacks display not only an affinity to the element earth but also to the element of air, as they instinctively use it to enhance their movement or more often to hinder that of their chosen foes.There are rare cases of reports that tell about good natured withered leaf golems. Almost all those cases can be linked to leaf golems inhabited by the spirits of former druids, that have become more accustomed with their changed nature. This versions of the withered leaf golems are often considerably more powerful then their spirit brethren. Malignant versions of this amalgamations also exist. They often are loners that claim entire forests as their own and act as their self proclaimed guardian, discouraging anyone to even enter the realm of their gruesome reign.",
