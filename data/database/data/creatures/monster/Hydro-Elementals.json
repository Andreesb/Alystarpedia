Since they cannot survive on land for long, they quickly retreat below sea level after their emergence and thus populate the reef caves beneath and around Marapur. Because of their elemental bodies, it is often difficult to distinguish them from the water around them. As they roam the reefs, they often capture coral branches, flotsam, pearls or small fish with their swirling bodies. These objects can then be seen swirling around in their watery shapes.",

Its body is often moulded into a humanoid shape, though its exact dimensions may vary depending on the amount of honey available.\nHoney elementals are born from large enchanted honeycombs in a process known as magical apiculture. The honey is exposed to powerful arcane forces, causing it to transform into sentient beings. The honey elemental never moves far away from its honey combs, as it has a strong and powerful connection to them. As it was born from a magically-enhanced honeycomb, the honey elemental feels an intrinsic attachment to them and considers them to be its nest and dwelling place. This connection is so strong that the honey elemental is compelled to always remain in close proximity to its honey combs, never moving too far away. One of the few reasons why a honey elemental will move a little further away from its combs are cherry drops. They are its favourite treat, and it often seeks them out to devour and consume.",

They usually live in the deep seas and it was never heard that they have ever left the sea at all. It is speculated that they draw a significant portion of their power from the surrounding sea and that they might turn into normal water elementals if they ever left the sea for a longer period. Massive Water Elementals are extremely powerful and can stand a considerable amount of damage. Using their liquid form, they can pass each terrain with ease and they usually try to get their prey as fast as they can, crushing it with their tremendous strength. Having immense magical powers, no one within sight can escape their ferocious attacks.Sometimes Massive Water Elementals seem to ally with energy elementals, particularly if a storm is approaching. It is unknown whether such alliances are formed by chance or if they are planned. Be that as it may, it is surely one of the worst nightmares that one can experience when two types of elementals attack a ship or a seaport while a violent storm is raging.
