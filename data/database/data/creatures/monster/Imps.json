        "notes": "Dark Torturers are distant relatives of the diabolic imps. Like all members of the imp family, they enjoy pain and havoc they wreak upon other creatures. Their physical abilities exceed by far those of their cousins, the diabolic imps. Since they lack the magical affinity of the latter, those creatures tend to sell their services to more powerful demons or even some malicious mortals. Given their somewhat lazy and cowardly nature, they prefer to take up the roles of jailers and torturers. There they can indulge their malicious instincts without risking too much in open warfare. Those disgusting qualities have earned this race the fitting name Dark Torturer in the vernacular.",

The only thing that allows them to exist in the demonic society, that has no tolerance for weakness, is their cunning and the magical forces they have under their command. Diabolic Imps tend to be somewhat cowardly and when it comes to the crunch, they esteem the value of their own lives much higher than any agenda of the master they might serve. For this reason, they are not trusted and, despite their intelligence, rarely appointed to any position of power or influence. The scheming little Diabolic Imps still found their niche in the demon society. They often serve in logistics or as messengers. In the latter role, they are frequently sent to the realm of the mortals. Here they even pose as advisors of mortal allies of the demon kind for a while. Diabolic Imps have 2 bosses: The Imperor and Minishabaal (not in game anymore).",

Try to corner them because when they use Haste they are extremely fast, and you won't be able to outrun them. A good strategy to kill these as a Mage at the Fenrock spawn is to Summon a Fire Devil or another creature immune to Fire Damage and let it block the ranged attacks while you use Ice Strike and Strong Ice Strike.
