Pictograms can be found in some places which show a civilised octopus-like race which apparently once dwelt in the deep. On those portrayals the race is served by creatures that look like the Lava Golems we know today. It seems the Lava Golems were once creations, servants or pets of that long extinct race. The fact that the Lava Golems of our time are now in service of 'those below' can be interpreted in many ways. Given the facts, it is most likely that the octopus creatures were conquered and annihilated by 'those below' and their creatures enslaved by the vile conquerors. Now the Lava Golems serve as faithful and unquestioning minions of their new masters. The Lava Golems are astonishingly passionless in their duty, usually doing nothing more than they were ordered to do. They quite obviously lack the destructiveness and rage that seems inherent in the other servants of 'those below'. Their masters coped with this issue by obviously giving them a set of rather broadly defined and extremely destructive orders like killing everything foreign in a certain area. That combined with their sheer power and destructive ability raises them to a completely different level of dangerousness: in the end the Lava Golems have to be seen on par with the other minions of those below.",

Its sheer mindless aggressiveness compared to the obvious strategic deployment of the Magma Crawler can lead to no other conclusion than that it is a biological weapon which is very difficult to control. It can safely be assumed that it originated in the breeding pens of what the gnomes call 'those below'. If this is the case, it is bred for war and destruction. It is probably deployed to do maximum damage in underground environments. After a Magma Crawler has been set loose, it is usually abandoned. This explains why wandering specimens can be found almost anywhere underground, usually at the end of a path of destruction. As only male Magma Crawlers have been found, it is assumed that the female creatures are retained for breeding purposes, and to prevent the race from spreading excessively. Given the longevity of the Magma Crawlers, this precautionary measure is not overly effective. Some captured specimens survived for dozens of years without showing significant signs of aging. Considering the threat even a single Magma Crawler poses, it is not unusual for a group of them to cause entire cave systems to collapse. It is not yet known if the Magma Crawlers somehow manage to escape the havoc they wreak or if they perish in it.",

        "notes": "The Vulcongra is one of the fastest diggers underground. The attempts of the dwarfs to replace their digging rotworms with Vulcongras were met with little success due to the Vulcongras' untrainable nature. The Vulcongras are almost purely by its instincts. Their foremost need seems to be hunger. Vulcongras spend most of their time on finding and eating. Since they can eat almost everything from dust to stones, they are literally eating constantly without any need of sleep or water. As there seems to be no way to scare them off, Vulcongras often become a threat for gnomish holdings. As they do not seem to care what they eat, the Vulcongras shun away from nothing. They could equally destroy a gnomish house as they would devour precious tools or crystals. They stoically fight back any attackers. Even when not attacked, someone often finds himself at the centre of a Vulcongra's eating attention as it tries to sample some bites. They lack any evil intention,though. The gnomes are experimenting on driving them away with certain crystal frequencies or lights, without any notable success till now. The Vulcongra seem to be just too dumb to be affected by any scare tactic. The stupidity and hunger of the Vulcongra is so prominent that they feature in many gnomish sayings such as 'hungry as a Vulcongra'.",

Though the gnomes fiercely deny it, it can be assumed that the Weepers served as inspiration for the construction of the first crystal golems. As an oddity of life, Weepers physically share only a few characteristics with truly living beings. It is all the more astonishing that in appearance and behaviour they could be confused with biological live forms. This raises a lot of questions about the Weepers and is fuel to dozens of more or less educated guesses about their origin. Some speculations see them as surviving servants of a long extinct race. Others point out the possibility that they are the offspring of early gnomish experiments. Some see the Weepers more in the array of elemental beings, going so far as to say that the Weepers are the incarnation of a new and to date undiscovered element. They got their name from the fiery 'tears' that usually leak in what would be considered their eye region as well as the odd sobbing sounds it emanates. Weepers are extremely unpredictable in their behaviour. The only constant seems to be their hatred for biological life which they attack fiercely and without restraint.",
