        "notes": "Although the Blue Djinns are considered entities of goodness they tend to guard their secrets well from nosy explorers, diligently performing any task they accepted. Being highly magical creatures, they are masters of illusion and transformation. Djinns are known for their witchcraft and fairy-tales commonly narrate about djinns granting people wishes. Magicians often mock this idea, arguing that only djinns bound by powerful magic feel obliged to such duties. Be that as it may, Blue Djinns are the weakest of their kind. Searching the world for the servants of evil and their eternal nemesis, the green djinns, they still pose a threat for all those they suspect of being in league with evil. These Magic Creatures are the counterpart of Green Djinn. Even though they are more amiable towards humans than the Green Djinn are, they will not tolerate anyone that aligns themselves with their greatest enemies.",

Considered to be extinct, the last knowledge of these powerful beings turned into legends and legends became fairy-tales. Those who have encountered the recently resurfaced, self-proclaimed masters of evil can attest that they are indeed, a reality, and not a pleasant one. These magic-wielding enemies of all good embrace destruction and enjoy causing pain. Although only inferior members of the green-skinned race have been sighted until now, they are enemies to beware of.  Their magical tricks make them more than a match for unexpecting adventurers. Despising all living beings and everything that is beautiful, their especially passionate hatred is reserved for their blue-skinned relatives, whom they regard as traitors to djinnkind. These Magic Creatures are the counterpart of Blue Djinn and a lower rank than Efreet. They can turn you into a rat and cancel your invisibility. You can receive a task to kill 500 green djinns of the Killing in the Name of... Quest. When you complete this task you may fight Merikh the Slaughterer.",

The Marid, being devout followers of the prophet Daraman's teachings, try to resist these temptations as well as they can, but it has happened before that a Marid strayed from the true path and succumbed to the corruption and the lowly desires that are hidden deep in the soul of every djinn. Beware of such fallen Marid, because they are no better than the Efreet, the Marids' green-skinned djinn cousins and arch-enemies.
