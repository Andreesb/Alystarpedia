        "notes": "Belonging to an unknown and possibly otherwise extinct breed of demons, Annihilon is pure power. It is said that Annihilon was responsible for the destruction of his own race. He is the last survivor of countless battles that mirrored the demonic version of the 'survival of the fittest' phrase. His massive, heavy body is just one huge mass of moving muscles. There is no place for finesse in his body full of sheer strength. What he lacks in skill, he easily makes up with raw power. This aeon-old creature has served many masters in his wretched life. It is assumed that he was already a follower of one of the Ruthless Seven when they started to form their cabal. He stayed stoical at their side during their rise to power. He was present at many of the greatest triumphs of his cruel masters. The Ruthless Seven often employed the rather simple-minded Annihilon for banal tasks as there is no known demon at their disposal that matches him in strength. As long as there is something to kill, Annihilon is absolutely loyal to his masters. This loyalty and his lack of ambition, apart from slaughter and killing, makes him to one of the preferred servants of the Ruthless Seven. He is the perfect tool to keep lesser demons in line and does not mind to use his strength to fulfil some smaller tasks that might be at hand. This ancient creature is often accompanied by parasites that feed on his dripping spicy sweat. Detecting some of these small but extremely nasty parasites is a helpful sign to know about Annihilon's presence in advance. It's one of the bosses of The Inquisition Quest.",

Simply trap the Knight blocking the Deathslicer with Magic Walls and then attack the Knight with the summons to kill the Deathslicer.) and other knights (about 3) to block Ghazbaran (Stone Skin Amulets are strongly recommended, cause this powerful creature can even kill a knight of level 200+ with one combo).

As the victory of the Ruthless Seven became more and more evident, he betrayed his allies and switched sides. Hellgorak decided it was better to serve under the Ruthless Seven than to die as a leader. Becoming a minion of the Ruthless Seven did not stop him from developing his evil plans. Slowly but steadily he climbed up in the ranks and used his new power and influence to improve himself. He called in favours, and killed those who possessed wisdom he needed. Over time, his demonic plans yielded fruits. With the help of stolen secrets and enchantments, his dark body is covered with glowing ancient runes that protect him from most harm. He boasts about his invulnerability which actually was proven a lie by the agents of the inquisition. Still, he shakes off most damage with ease, and it would for sure take an insane amount of attackers to bring him down. It was prophesied that no man will beat him - right before he killed the oracle. Still, he fears the Ruthless Seven who defeated him and his allies in the past. Therefore, it is safe to say that, even though he is nearly invulnerable, Hellgorak is all but immortal. It's one of the bosses of The Inquisition Quest.",

Instead of creating a brilliant leader, though, they gave birth to a savage killing machine that constantly tries to improve his skills by challenging other demonic minions. Even if Madareth only uses a fraction of his skills, the usual outcome of such fights is a stack of Juggernauts and demons hacked to pieces. It is rumoured that he even defeated the mighty Orshabaal. His only weakness might be the single-mindedness with which he pursues the destruction of his victims. In his lust for battle, he often forgets his surrounding and lives only for the moment of his next strike. Though Madareth loves playing cat and mouse with his victims, he quickly loses all finesse and fully indulges in his blood lust. It is unknown how such a beast is kept in check by The Ruthless Seven. It's one of the bosses of The Inquisition Quest.",

        "notes": "He is a Ruthless Seven Servant, and you must defeat him in order to proceed through The Inquisition Quest. Despite his might, the demon known as Zugurosh is a coward, and he would be the first to admit that - if he were threatened enough. Zugurosh spent a good part of his past hiding from real and assumed enemies. Seeking for protection, he joined the ranks of The Ruthless Seven soon after they had established themselves as the mightiest of all surviving cabals. Though he is quick on the uptake, his cowardice prevented him from gaining any significant power until his paranoia helped him to discover a treachery in the ranks of The Ruthless Seven Minions. This granted him the attention of his dark masters and a rather high position in their ranks that only resulted in intensifying his fears. Zugurosh prefers to be a living coward than a dead hero. Ironically his cowardice and paranoia made him a valuable tool for The Ruthless Seven who entrusted him with several safety measures for their numerous operations. Assuming enemies and betrayal everywhere, Zugurosh is responsible for some of the most important and essential safety measures of The Ruthless Seven. He has a rather unique network of bribed and threatened informants. Though treachery and backstabbing is quite common among demons, this kind of controlled betrayal on a grand scale is a rather unusual concept for their race, and so far it works quite well. Zugurosh hates every fair fight, and he ensures that things are in his favour before he makes his move. He enjoys to prey upon helpless victims and loves nothing more than cheap victories using deceit, traps and ambushes. Since demons do not mind much about such tactics, Zugurosh is quite respected by his kind. It's one of the bosses of The Inquisition Quest.",
