        "notes": "All goblins employ stealth and treachery as legitimate means to win a battle. This goes so far that the goblin culture actually encourages and adores such methods. Though Goblin Assassins are hardly anything else than 'wannabe assassins',  they are indeed the most tricky and cunning of their kind. They use everything at their disposal for fighting including dirty trick. They enjoy stealthy attacks and the use of paralysing poison to eliminate their enemies. Amongst their kind, they are revered as heroes. They often hold high positions, gained by trickery to get rid of other contenders for leadership. Every goblin chieftain has a bunch of assassins as close advisors. Since the king knows that his advisors would gladly stab him in the back to succeed him as chief, he plays a difficult game of playing off the Goblin Assassins against each other and sending them on suicidal missions to get rid of them. So, being a Goblin Assassin is a mixed blessing. It is desirable as it ensures a position of power which all goblins long for. At the same time, it is a threat for a goblin's life.In battles, Goblin Assassins try to be as effective as necessary to keep their position and as inconspicuous as possible to avoid the attention of both, their opponents and their fellow assassins. To some extend, this restricts the assassin's effectiveness, though when under pressure, he usually plays out all of his tricks to either flee or to kill his opponent.",

In the camps, older Goblin Scavengers sort out the loot the raiders and warriors get into their hands. The younger Goblin Scavengers are sent out into the wilderness to loot and plunder everything they can get. Usually they form parties that sneak about the lands of their enemies and try to get as much loot as possible. It is said that the loot bag, still very popular among modern adventurers, was an invention of Goblin Scavengers.When surrounded by enemies, they try to keep a distance and to attack from afar. Since Goblin Scavengers are usually seasoned scouts, they also possess some knowledge about the wilderness and plants. This enables them to poison their weapons with a moderate effect.You never know what kind of loot a Goblin Scavenger might dig up from his pockets. It can be everything from a rune to much more valuable items. Goblin Scavengers occur either alone on a mission as a scout, in small groups of two or three, or as a band consisting of up to two dozens.",
