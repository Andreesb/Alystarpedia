He is the last survivor of countless battles that mirrored the demonic version of the 'survival of the fittest' phrase. His massive, heavy body is just one huge mass of moving muscles. There is no place for finesse in his body full of sheer strength. What he lacks in skill, he easily makes up with raw power. This aeon-old creature has served many masters in his wretched life. It is assumed that he was already a follower of one of the Ruthless Seven when they started to form their cabal. He stayed stoical at their side during their rise to power. He was present at many of the greatest triumphs of his cruel masters. The Ruthless Seven often employed the rather simple-minded Annihilon for banal tasks as there is no known demon at their disposal that matches him in strength. As long as there is something to kill, Annihilon is absolutely loyal to his masters. This loyalty and his lack of ambition, apart from slaughter and killing, makes him to one of the preferred servants of the Ruthless Seven. He is the perfect tool to keep lesser demons in line and does not mind to use his strength to fulfil some smaller tasks that might be at hand. This ancient creature is often accompanied by parasites that feed on his dripping spicy sweat. Detecting some of these small but extremely nasty parasites is a helpful sign to know about Annihilon's presence in advance. It's one of the bosses of The Inquisition Quest.",

After that place two boxes or honey flowers to keep the minotaurs out and only fight Apprentice Sheng and 2 hyaenas (10-20 small health potions is best to keep yourself from dying). Another way is using poison arrows to lower defense, and spears to kill the boss. Strategy for a single player: Stand in the oven room on the tile marked with white square on the screenshot, the Apprentice Sheng will keep the distance from you, but he will keep coming back to the tile marked with red square on the screenshot. Each time he comes back, you will hit him. At the same time you will only be attacked by a maximum of two other monsters, standing to your right.

They ended up being gorily sacrificed and eaten before his eyes after dying a painful death from the poison. He wrote those experiences down in his notes, and from these it actually appears that he eventually died himself too. Here he is, however, very much alive.",

Additionally, failing the final battle will remove the last two taints and erase the progress of two random bosses. The erased progress of the two bosses, while random, should be the same for the whole team. Players have 25 minutes to finish this fight. The following information considers a team fighting the boss on the easiest mode possible. For harder modes, players must consider the effects of having the final taint and burdens. Bakragore fights together with four Elder Bloodjaws and combines some of the mechanics of its children, but with important changes. The boss can summon up to four  Mushrooms, and it leaves mould tracks on the ground where it walks. It also heals lightly when stepping on its own tracks. During the fight, players have a counter next to their names increasing by two per second to a maximum of 20. Each time a player moves, they \"drop\" these charges on the ground, leaving  Darkfields as tracks for three seconds and reducing the counter by one. Staying over the Darkfields causes 3,4% maximum health per second as Agony Damage, which is increased under maximum stacks to 20,5% maximum health per second. The boss can summon up to four  Pillars of Dark Energy, that can chain players for Death Damage. When taking damage from this chain spell, a different counter is applied to the characters hit by it. This counter is reduced at a rate of one per second and deals 1,500+ Death Damage with every tick. The maximum counter value is 10. Players should be extra careful when having these because getting hit by Bakragore's beam spell will trigger all charges at once, dealing a high Death Damage outburst. Every 90 seconds, Bakragore will drop a Rotten Charge at the center of the room that lasts for 15 seconds. If no Elder Bloodjaw steps on it: If an Elder Bloodjaw steps on it: The fight against Bakragore can be made harder and more rewarding if players sacrifice at least one of its minion's essence before starting. For each essence they sacrifice, an  Elder Bloodjaw will be replaced by an echo of the corresponding boss, but rewards will be applied for that fight. See Bakragore's Burden for all the details.",

A basic strategy consists of the Knight blocking the Black Knight and Challenges it whenever it retargets, while the Druid/Sorcerer uses the above. But the most efficient duo-strategy to kill it faster would be a Knight blocking while a Paladin uses Divine Missiles.\nNot a good creature to do a fast hunt on since he takes quite some time to respawn (around 10 minutes with regards to the server state).\nIt is possible for a Paladin to solo this creature at level 50. It is reccomended that you take either Royal Spears or Enchanted Spears and a good shield, though you should kill the Bonelords first to avoid mana drain. If you can, also kill the Scorpions too.

The darkfields deal 3% of a character's maximum HP as Agony Damage when stepped on, or once every second while standing on it. The boss will heal if it comes into contact with the players tracks. It fights together with two  Elder Bloodjaws, not considering modifiers from taints. The boss can summon multiple  Pillars of Dark Energy. These can chain players for Fire Damage. When taking damage from this chain spell, a different counter is applied to the characters hit by it. This counter is reduced at a rate of one per second and deals 1,200~ Fire Damage with every tick. The maximum counter value is 10. Players should be extra careful when having these because getting hit by Chagorz's beam spell will trigger all charges at once, dealing a high Fire Damage outburst. Every 90 seconds, Chagorz will drop a  Rotten Charge at the center of the room that lasts for 15 seconds. If no Elder Bloodjaw steps on it: If an Elder Bloodjaw steps on it:",

Due to his physical immunity, mages are highly recommended. Paladins should use elemental arrows and knights enchanted weapons. His mana drain makes up a lot of his damage, so knights can quite easily block it. Bronze Amulets may be a good choice for mages and Garlic Necklaces for knights. Knights: enter the room first to distract the pillars. Be sure to challenge the pharaoh to protect the shooters. Dipthrah will drain your mana a lot and most of your attack spells will be blocked, so it may be a good idea to just block the pharaoh. It may help your shooters to shoot Fire Bombs for their safety.\nPaladins: if there is a knight, stand behind him and shoot with elemental arrows. If there is no knight, you can substitute a blocker with some difficulties (you will need a healer - your mana will be depleted fast).\nMages: shoot from a distance with Flame Strike or Ice Strike. A mage (preferably druid for Mass Healing) can quite easily camp this pharaoh alone after the first clear by having a Demon Skeleton summon block for them. In this strategy, the knight will enter first and attract the pillars. After the first clear, the knight leaves the room and the DS are attacked (if they are closest to the pillars). The pharaoh cannot easily kill a DS because most of its damage is from Life Drain. Bomb runes will prevent the pharaoh from reaching the mage and Fireball or Icicle runes can be used to attack the pharaoh without moving the summons (if the summons move, the pharaoh is more likely to attack the mage). Setting up in the north-west corner of the room will also permit 2-3 Bonelords spawning.",

Along with that, around each player a large magic spell of the corresponding element (water/fire) will appear every turn. If two players that have different appearances get near each other, they'll take around 2000 damage. In order to avoid this, the recommended strategy is to have the knight positioned at the center of the room with the boss and the other team members around him, at safe distance. The transformation resets every few seconds, which means that in case a shooter has a summon targeting him, this player can wait until his transformation matches the Knight's and bring him the summon. This must be done fast however to avoid a change in the appearance in the meantime.",

Remember that with its high resistance to physical attacks, even a skilled knight can only do 150 damage on average with Fierce Berserk.

When Feroxa walks on these traps, she will be damaged for 1,000 health points and the traps will vanish. The traps can be stacked and she does not heal, so it's a matter of having enough traps to bring the boss to half health. As an alternative, sorcerers and druids can summon either Gozzlers or Ghouls to deal Life Drain damage, but this process takes a lot longer. At half health, she will change into her killable werewolf form. Now you must attack her with all your firepower. When she reaches 0 health she will either turn into her weak human form or her gloom wolf form, both of which are quite weak and must be taken down with sheer firepower. You will receive two sets of loot for the whole battle. Only the final form of Feroxa (Gloom Wolf) will grant you a kill count in the Bosstiary.",

Ferumbras was an evil sorcerer who once instilled fear into the heart of Thaians many years ago. Summoning demons and warlocks, he attacked Thais twice during the span of his life. After his second attack, he was finally killed and most assumed him to be gone for good. But his wrath was brought down when he returned some time later and found his daughter, Fortinbrae, had been killed and her soul trapped by the brave knights who had slain her, in the Plains of Havoc temple. Ferumbras traveled there to recapture his daughter's soul, but he was defeated again and disappeared. There are many rumors about his current whereabouts. After he was slain, he produced several oddly-charged runes, including a Sudden Death rune with 0 charges and a Poison Bomb rune with over 30 charges. There are 2 Magic Pillars at his room, which can summon up to 3 Demons each. Ferumbras was first sighted on Eternia on August 21th 2006, but a bug prevented players from reaching him. He appeared there again after two weeks when the bug had been fixed. He was first killed on Antica on October 13th 2006. Before he appears, three messages are broadcast in white text to all players on that world: What people have to say about Ferumbras",

The strategy to defeat Gaz'haragoth is similar whether he is fought on top of the mountain or locked in the prison. The primary difference lies in the player's levels, as the initial encounter will likely involve lower-level characters. High-level knights (700+) can block Gaz'haragoth with the support of healers, but they must be ready to flee from the Death and Doom ability. The recommended strategy is to block him near a ramp, allowing shooters to move up and down easily. Ensure there is a vortex nearby to escape to the Nightmare. Be cautious of heavy paralyze effects, which can make escape difficult. On low-population servers, defeating Gaz'haragoth before he heals may be challenging. Some announcements hint that the nightmares can be killed to prevent his healing. This approach may provide an alternate means to defeat him.",

From the entrance, go to the Fire Section and go down to the second floor. Go to the room south-east where you will find the teleport. Enter it and pull the Ostentatious Bookstand once your team is ready for the fight. You will have 17 minutes to finish the fight. The Secret Library Quest - Ghulosh During the fight, Ghulosh will transform into Ghulosh' Deathgaze. The objective will be to get rid of the Deathgaze, but players can not kill it, as it takes no damage from them. First, destroy The Book of Death that spawns north of the room to release a Concentrated Death (it is advised that you initially attack the book until it is on red HP first, and then just finish it when required). Now, you have to line up Ghulosh' Deathgaze with the Concentrated Death. This is because Gulosh' Death Beam actually deals heavy Drown Damage to players, but it hurts itself for 6000~8600 damage when hitting the Concentrated Death because of Damage Reflection. The Concentrated Death dies rather quickly by players and summons attacks, so make sure not to damage it yourself. If it dies, the book will shortly respawn so you can kill it to spawn another one. The Deathgaze is a ranged creature and cannot be fully trapped or it will teleport to the center of the room. To control it, it is recommended that the Knight Challenges it and forces it to one of the wall corners. Then, Magic Wall Runes and Wild Growth Runes can be used to prevent the Deathgaze from walking to the sides. Meanwhile, another player should be bringing the Concentrated Death to place it in front of the Deathgaze, as shown below. The first two times that Ghulosh' Deathgaze hits the Concentrated Death, it will be immediately enough damage to transform it back into Ghulosh. The third time, however, will require you to make the Deathgaze to hit itself several times until it transforms back, and then you'll finally be able to finish the boss. During the fight, you will also have to deal with several Bone Jaws as well as Blood Tears. The Bone Jaws should be cleared whenever possible so they do not pile up, but the Blood Tears respawn immediately upon dying, so do not waste resources or time on them. Make sure not to damage or kill the Concentrated Death in the process of clearing the minions.",

Gnomevil's toughest move is his melee. His beams cause mana drain, electrification and burning, making him easier for knights to block. If trapped, Gnomevil's damage can be countered with relative ease. The general strategy is to have 3-4 players (preferably knights) block Gnomevil's adjacent squares and have the shooters fire until he's dead. The player being attacked by Gnomevil (usually the highest level mage) should position themselves behind the main blocking knight, so that Gnomevil is most commonly facing them, absorbing the beams for the other knights to save mana. Challenge is probably a bad idea while Gnomevil is trapped because it would direct strong melee damage to the knight for a single turn, before Gnomevil again retargets to the highest damage dealer. For small team, it's recommended to trap boss where he spawn with 1 or 2 blockers and all shooters should stay north west of boss, this way boss wont chase them if one of blockers stand 1sqm north of his spawn position.",

Enter it and pull the Ostentatious Bookstand once your team is ready for the fight. You will have 17 minutes to finish the fight. The Secret Library Quest - Gorzindel To kill Gorzindel you will first have to weaken it. To do so, start by attacking the Stolen Tome of Portals north of the room (you can ignore the Malicious and Mean Minions for now). When it dies, its corpse will be a teleport in which everyone should quickly jump into (since the boss deals heavy Paralysis, it is better to walk towards the Book when it is about to die). Each team member will be sent to a separate small room with a Malicious Minion and another book that is responsible for one of the boss' abilities or strengths. You will have around 4 turns to attack it before being sent to the main room again. Note that after returning from the small rooms, several minions will have spawned in the main room, being able to hit for significant damage if they combo, so it's better to use Avalanche Runes on them to clear the room, specially from the Malicious Minions which die faster. Repeat this process until all 5 books are dead and the boss is weakened. The following books must be destroyed: When the 5 books are dead, all that is left is for players to attack Gorzindel until it dies. During this time, it is recommended that the shooters stay near the left wall of the room to avoid the Stolen Tome's Death spell around itself.",

During the battle, once the boss reaches red health, he will summon a Falcon Knight or a Falcon Paladin and heal completely, as well as keep healing for every amount of damage you deal to him and start arguing with you, popping up an orange message until someone speaks in Local Chat Channel or NPCs Channel, then he will stop talking and become vulnerable again. Each time he gets to red HP and heals, there will be a different message from him, and in order to defeat him you must reply with the correct argument. This verbal confrontation has to be done correctly 3 times during the fight so that the boss can be killed. When you reply with the correct answer, Oberon will grunt (GRRRAAANNGH!), but if you do not reply correctly, he will laugh at you (HAHAHAHA!). All the arguments you need to reply are described in the documents that you can find inside the castle. There is a total of 8 volumes, and each one contains a quote. Tip: Since killing Oberon is a daily routine for many players, it is useful to have the answers in hotkeys or action buttons. Due to how dialog with NPCs works in Tibia, it is possible to setup only 2 buttons with all the answers, and you can use two others to indicate which button to use. This works by combining the replies to the 3 arguments that start with a T (I, VIII and IX) in one message, and the remaining replies on another. The correct reply will be recognized even when it is mixed with other replies. The reason you can not use a single message for all replies is that it would exceed the character limit for a message. You can set two buttons with the replies above and two to indicate which is which, like this: ",

As the victory of the Ruthless Seven became more and more evident, he betrayed his allies and switched sides. Hellgorak decided it was better to serve under the Ruthless Seven than to die as a leader. Becoming a minion of the Ruthless Seven did not stop him from developing his evil plans. Slowly but steadily he climbed up in the ranks and used his new power and influence to improve himself. He called in favours, and killed those who possessed wisdom he needed. Over time, his demonic plans yielded fruits. With the help of stolen secrets and enchantments, his dark body is covered with glowing ancient runes that protect him from most harm. He boasts about his invulnerability which actually was proven a lie by the agents of the inquisition. Still, he shakes off most damage with ease, and it would for sure take an insane amount of attackers to bring him down. It was prophesied that no man will beat him - right before he killed the oracle. Still, he fears the Ruthless Seven who defeated him and his allies in the past. Therefore, it is safe to say that, even though he is nearly invulnerable, Hellgorak is all but immortal. It's one of the bosses of The Inquisition Quest.",

It has three main challenges that players must face during the whole fight: There are two common strategies used on the fight. One is to have the Knight use Challenge on all Elder Bloodjaws and stand in a corner, with one Druid staying nearby to heal them. This is because the room is big enough that the Paladin can then run a half-lap on the other side of the room, having basically three shooters staying away from the Elder Bloodjaws vision the entire fight and avoiding swapping caused by the first taint. Another is to repeat the strategy used in Murcion, where the Knight just runs the full lap as well, staying half a lap behind the Paladin.",

Irahsae is not too strong, but the blocker could take considerably high combos of up to 700 damage, maybe more. An Elite Knight of level 55 and higher with good skills and a good set should be able to survive blocking this monster us Strong Health Potions.

He sometimes does high damage so Mana shield is recommended for Mages around level 45.Paladins stay away while shooting bolts / arrows / throwing weapons and Exori San (Holy Damage). Some Health Potions would be good. Make sure to have enough mana for Exura, as the Bonebeast can Paralyze you.Knights will have a very hard time with this one, as he has many life draining attacks, coupled with the fast healing. Not recommended for Knights under level 70 (Fierce Berserk), unless you are experienced. It's also recommended to bring a shooter to help with the killing. As a knight a 20-40 Mana Potions and a few Strong Health Potions are needed as he hits hard. Also a good idea to wear a Garlic Necklace, as it has many Life Drain attacks.Note: that he will respawn shortly after you've killed him, unless you know what to do.\nPart of the Koshei The Deathless Quest. Can only be successfully defeated if you use the Koshei's Ancient Amulet on his corpse.",

Enter it and pull the Ostentatious Bookstand once your team is ready for the fight. You will have 17 minutes to finish the fight. Start by attacking the boss. A few moments later, the team will be sent to the center of the room with the invincible boss and trapped by Force Fields (they look like Magic Walls). At this moment, the team should all focus on the same Force Field and kill it as soon as possible to leave the trap, because within the trap Lokathmor will repeatedly cause an explosion that deals death damage, starting with around 700 damage that increases rapidly with each turn. After leaving the trap area, be aware that the range of the explosion will still reach 1sqm in front of the Force Fields. Therefore, safety is only assured after each member is at least 2sqms away from them. The Force Fields also do not block spells, and so both the explosions from the boss and your own attacks will hit through them. A Dark Knowledge will spawn north of the room. Kill it fast and quickly pick up its corpse (a Parchment of Dark Knowledge), use it on the Writing Desk on the west side of the room, and then use the desk, it will destroy the remaining Force Fields and set Lokathmor free, allowing the team to attack it for 20 seconds. After this period, the trap will restart, and players will have to repeat these steps until the boss has been killed. Time is of utmost importance in this fight, and losing one turn may be decisive for a failure. Some hints for optimal performance are:",

Even if Madareth only uses a fraction of his skills, the usual outcome of such fights is a stack of Juggernauts and demons hacked to pieces. It is rumoured that he even defeated the mighty Orshabaal. His only weakness might be the single-mindedness with which he pursues the destruction of his victims. In his lust for battle, he often forgets his surrounding and lives only for the moment of his next strike. Though Madareth loves playing cat and mouse with his victims, he quickly loses all finesse and fully indulges in his blood lust. It is unknown how such a beast is kept in check by The Ruthless Seven.

Maxxenius is healed by Energy Damage, so this element shouldn't be used by players. Furthermore, there are Generators that constantly use an Energy spell around them, and the outer tiles of the room will also pulsate with an energy spell. Thus, Maxxenius must be blocked away from these fields. The north-west area of the room is ideal for that, but i can also be done on the east side of the room. 2. During the fight, Maxxenius will frequently transform its target in an Energy Elemental. About 10 seconds after the transformation, the player will \"explode\" dealing 1000-1500 energy damage around him (2 fields radius). Thus, in order to avoid healing the boss, this player should move away from it. This can be done easily if there are 2 Knights and the one that isn't transformed Challenges Maxxenius so the other one can run away. In case no second Knight is available, the same result can also be achieved but the players will have to force Maxxenius to change target without using Challenge.",

Enter it and pull the Ostentatious Bookstand once your team is ready for the fight. You will have 17 minutes to finish the fight. The Secret Library Quest - Mazzinor Together with this boss there will be several Wild Knowledges . Once you kill them, they will become a blue vortex. Every few rounds, Mazzinor will become Supercharged Mazzinor, which is invincible. After 8 seconds, the room will be hit by several simultaneous energy explosions with different center points around the room. This will cover all squares in the room and deal up to 13,000+ Energy Damage, depending on where you are standing. The closer to the center of the room players are, the higher the damage taken as they will be hit by more explosions. This damage, however, can be avoided entirely if players step on the existing vortexes to gain the form of a Knowledge Elemental . Note that this form also lasts 8 seconds, so it is recommended that you wait at least 2 seconds after the boss transformation to step on the vortex, guaranteeing your new form will last long enough. Players can only renew the form after it runs out, so if you transform too soon you will be susceptible to the explosions. Repeat this process until the boss is dead. This fight can go bad very easily if the team starts taking the explosions. A possible strategy is having the blocker stay with Mazzinor near the center of the room, and the shooters spread around them. Everyone should attack with Stone Shower Runes, hitting multiple Wild Knowledges and creating many vortexes. Furthermore, everyone should always choose a vortex to step on as soon as possible and stand next to it, preferably communicating this to the team. Communication is extremely important to avoid taking vortexes that other players were planning to use, causing chaos and possibly deaths. Other tips:",

You can consider this boss as a stronger Efreet with a lot of hitpoints. Any vocation should kill him quickly before his summons increase total damage. Paladins should run and use Assassin Stars. Mages should simply attack him with SD's and/or Ice Strike. Knights: Since moving is not necessary while fighting him, you bring a strong two handed weapon and wear a Sword, Axe, or Club Ring while fighting him and wear your Dwarven Ring later. Also, bring along some mana potions to attack him with berserk, heal if your hp gets below 500, and 800 if he has both summons.",

Even though it is still possible to deal damage to it in the enraged form, it will not be very efficient. When it is in Furious stage, it will take very little damage and reflect a lot more of it, so teams should avoid reaching this stage as it is both dangerous and expensive to fight it. While being targeted, the blockers will slowly build up a counter next to their name as well. When this counter reaches 20, the character will take more damage and Morshabaal will heal more through Lifesteal. The counter can be decreased by letting another blocker be the target. The common strategy for killing Morshabaal is the following: The blockers (preferably 3 level 600+ Elite Knights) bring Morshabaal to the north-east corner of the room and trap it next to one of the pillars. All shooters must stack diagonally near the eastern wall between two pillars. Players should only attack when the counter is above 5 and stop before it changes to the red symbol. The blockers should keep switching positions and taking turns at blocking it so that all knights can reduce their counters. Keep repeating the process of attacking and waiting to slowly reduce Morshabaal's health until it is defeated. There are several key factors that must be taken into account during the fight:",

It has three main challenges that players must face during the whole fight: This is one of the harder fights due to the small room, which leaves very little place to run around. The common strategy is to have the Paladin immediately grab the target from Murcion, then run around in a circle as wide as possible. The movement flow is very important, because if the Paladin moves too fast they will complete a whole lap before the mould tracks have disappeared, but if they move too slow the boss will end up healing from standing on its track. Paladins should also avoid diagonal steps as much as possible, since Murcion constantly uses its Paralyse spell, and this could cause the boss to stand still for too long and end up healing. All shooters should avoid getting close to the boss to avoid drawing its target. If the boss switches target to any shooter, they should immediately run on the same direction that Paladin was moving towards, to keep Murcion moving on the correct direction. Failing to react quickly will cause the boss to stand on its mould tracks and heal. Lower level teams can not afford to have the boss heal this way multiple times, or they will run out of time to kill the boss. The Knight should Challenge the Elder Bloodjaws as soon as they spawn, and run around the room in the same direction as the Paladin, but falling behind around half a lap, so that they are always at the opposite side of the room. Knights should try to step near the Mushrooms when running their lap, to help clear the path for the Paladin's next lap. The clearer the path is for the Paladin, the easier it will be to keep the movement flow of Murcion. However, a balance should also be found, because the boss has a limit to how many Mushrooms can be active at the same time, and leaving a few behind might be desirable to avoid situations where the boss summons enough mushrooms to trap itself in them, causing it to stand still and significantly heal multiple times in a very short period.",

Then you can choose between these two ways of killing:Short: Once he is trapped kill him using single-target attacks such as Ice Strike, Icicle Runes or Sudden Death Runes and make sure you do not kill a single flame. If you managed not to kill a single flame he will fight until death without exploding.\nLong: Once he is trapped attack him using the spells and runes you would like. This time you do not have to pay attention to his flames. Keep attacking him until he exploded a total of three times and then kill him as he will not explode a fourth time no matter if you kill his flames again or not.\nNOTE: Apparently he always explodes in the last hit (one time at least).",

It is a Demon Lord who normally hides very deep down in the depths of The Edron Hero Cave.\nIts magical and physical powers are overwhelming! Many brave heroes have fallen by the great fireball and energy beam it utilizes. To make matters worse, it flees when it reaches red health, and if the adventurers are not fast enough in killing it, Orshabaal's vile healing magic will allow it to return to the fray. Whenever it chooses to raid a world it won't come alone, it brings a lot of Demons as company to help spread death and disaster. Even though Orshabaal has since lost his title of strongest monster, he remains the most infamous, due to his spawn location on the surface (the Triangle of Terror hide deep below the surface, and Ferumbras sits at the very top of his citadel). You are able to use Blessed Wooden Stake on his corpse as well as on all his summoned demon's corpses, in order to get Demon Dust. Sometimes Orshabaal gets trapped by his own Demons because he doesn't kill his summons like Scarabs kill Larvas. Orshabaal was first sighted on Pacera, Aug 26th 2005.\nHe was first killed on Titania, Sept 11th 2005. To all players on the world it appears, 3 messages are broadcasted in white text.",

In such cases, the best strategy is try to position yourself around its spawn location and attack it as soon as possible when it appears. If the server is new, or if there are few players online, you may use the strategy that was for a long time the only way to kill this once-fearsome boss. Lure it to the famous spot near the entrance of Cyclopolis. When it is at red health, shoot Magic Walls so it cannot run away. The blocker should party mode with the shooters and get the loot as soon as possible after killing it.\nSince it is likely the blocker will not be able to heal quickly enough when Orshabaal performs a strong combo, it is advised to have at least a few mages using Ultimate Healing or Exura Sio on the blocker. A good strategy is luring Orshabaal into a place that you can block only him between 2 trees, or in a corridor where 1-2 Demons limit its movement, helping avoid the line-of-sight attacks. Also its possible to use a medium level char (or a low level) as bait to lure him in a place where he will get trapped by his summons, after that people can easily shoot and Orshabaal will not move until its near death. Also, keep in mind that when the blocker is blocking Orshabaal, it will still tend to use Great Fireball and Great Energy Beam, so you may want to stand diagonally and far away from it to avoid these attacks or you may experience a quick death.",

All shooters should attack mainly with Great Fireball Runes in order to kill the summons around the blocker. During the fight, Plagirath will sometimes transform its target into a Bog Raider. When this transformation runs out after about 10 seconds, the transformed player will \"explode\" receiving 1500 damage and that will also hit the players around him. Since running around the room is not recommended, shooters should stay distant from the blocker and when the transformation happens everyone should make sure they have enough mana and health to take the explosion. Note that once Plagirath dies, the Disgusting Oozes will not disappear, so leaving the boss room must also be done carefully and in an organized manner. Killing the boss near the exit will make this last step safer.",

When he shouts \"GET OVER HERE!\", all players in the room are teleported next to him. His retargeting is also rather frequent.",
        "strategy": "Prince Drazzak All vocations should wear as much protection against Death Damage as possible (remember that many items can be imbued with Powerful Lich Shroud), followed by protection against the vocation's element (see abilities). The boss is resistant to damage, has a lot of hitpoints and heals a lot; prepare for a long battle (15-25 minutes). The most dangerous parts of the fight are the moments and Prince Drazzak teleports everyone to him, since he usually uses his Death spells immediately after that. Because of this, the whole team should be able to take and/or reduce about 6000 Death Damage. When the Demons spawn (they are not actually summons but regular Demons), quickly pass them to the blocker (but keep an eye on the UE warnings) and kill them, they can be quite a hassle if still alive when the boss teleports the team. Paladins, Sorcerers and Druids should bring the mana recovering dish and cupcake for emergencies, which can happen if the boss teleports the team twice in a short time. Knights: In order to safely block this boss, the should be able to take the Fire UE damage (level 450+ recommended). Even though it can hit quite a lot, with the proper protection it will be safer for the team as a whole if the Knight takes this damage and quickly heal afterwards, which shouldn't be very hard since the spell is announced beforehand. Paladins: The vocation with a greater chance of dying due to the high Death Damage from the boss teleport and the slow mana recovering. Wearing Energy Rings as well as Stone Skin Amulets (40 should be enough) are strongly recommended. Always keep an eye on your Ring duration and Amulet charges and replace them before they run out. When the Demons are summoned they will quickly use up the SSA charges, get rid of them as fast as possible to equip a new one. Mages: Might Rings will greatly reduce the damage taken, 20 should be more than enough for the fight (remember to replace them). Always keep the boss and the blocker on the limit of your game window to make sure you're outside the UE range, which is quite large. Druids should wear Earth Damage protection where Death protection isn't possible in case they take the damage. Bring at least 500 SDs and 500 UMPs - this fight takes a while.",

So even if it looks like an undead dragon don't bother with exori vis. It seems that it doesn't have any resistance or weakness to ice, so your best bet could be exori frigo, icicle or avalanche (will help kill the summons as well). The room you face it in is large enough to run it. So just run it and watch your mana/hp. Another way you can do it is put a couple fire bombs or a fire wall and he will walk around it.\nKnight: should use the 2 diagonal fire fields in the center, this will keep Pythius from moving and at the same time you will avoid the waves. Moreover, it is recommended to use a poison bomb at the corner, so that the summoned Undead Gladiator cannot attack you with melee. As a picture has done below. Level 110+ recomended, healing with 1000 HP using GHP. Like this: Knight Level 113 killing Pythius the Rotten Use Fire Field to keep Pythius the Rotten standing at diagonal spot.And use poison bomb to block summoned Undead Gladiator, so that it couldn't come to you. All Vocations: should kill it fast as you can. You need a Golden Mug to reach it. Also one great idea is for every vocation to use might ring or death ring even though it reduces your shielding by -10 it also reduces death damage so there is less chances of catching the curse and its death attacks will not as hurt you much.\nElven Amulet and Stone Skin Amulet are also great ideas. In the treasure room it is recomended to use Koshei's Ancient Amulet or Death Ring or any other death protection equips to not die to curse.\nLevel 139 EK (Rhysypie Too) killing Pythius the Rotten.",

Keeping Samael's cage locked and in good shape is needed to \"prevent the apocalypse\", according to Eclesius who refers to him as a Demon Uberoverlord.\nIts name is confirmed by his fellow inmate A Confused Frog who describes Samael as an annoyed Demon Overlord.\nIt is not possible to see Samael from any known place in Tibia, however it is possible to hear his screams from outside his cellar, from this cave in Thais sewers and from Thais prison.\nAlthough some players believe it might be possible to reach and face Samael, there is no sustainable evidence that points the devs ever intended to make it possible for players to reach Samael.",

It's best to make them run away, as they won't respawn and you can focus on fighting Sir Valorcrest, just keep using Great Health Potions as often as you can, whether you need them or not, as a strong combo can give you a free trip to the Temple. If your health goes below 200 it's recommended to go upstairs to heal and then go back.\nMages should have a blocker and shoot with fire spells, but other elements work too.\nPaladins: Same strategy as mage, blocker and shoot with bolts/Enchanted Spears while using Divine Missile. \nHigher Level Knight can block it (100+) while a Paladin/Mage quickly kill it.",

        "notes": "Tanjis, Expeditus Profundis, is one of the three depth lords. He is the most harmless but most frequently appearing of the deepling guardians. Access to his lair is earned by helping to repair the ramp to the Ancestral Grounds, during the Liquid Black Quest. Teams may enter each guardian's lair once for each time they make a sufficient attempt to repair the ramp to the Ancestral Grounds. However, access to any further guardians is revoked if players open any treasure chest outside of their lairs. Tanjis spawns each 3-10 minutes depending on players online, and cannot be blocked from spawning (same as the inquisition bosses, pharaohs and the black knight). Teams can stay in Tanjis' room for 20 minutes, the timer starting when they enter the teleport. Reentry is denied after players gain experience from Tanjis. Thus, teams can earn a few minutes by jumping out and in Tanjis' lair when the first Tanjis is on his last hitpoints. Tanjis always drops exactly one item: Depth Ocrea, Ornate Mace, or Ornate Shield. Players who receive experience from killing Tanjis will be able to open the treasure chest outside of his lair, to receive Trophy of Tanjis, 20 Platinum Coins, Necklace of the Deep, Warrior's Shield and either Tanjis' Sight or 10 Black Pearls.

Because of his retargeting behavior, the shooters are advised to stand away from Tanjis while the blocker lures and traps him.

Once trapped, it's a battle against his healing. Tanjis will attack shooters very frequently, even when trapped. Shooters can expect to be hit with strong Mana Drain and Ice-based attacks every 2-5 turns. Shooters are recommended to position themselves away from other team members, or move to another location when they find themselves being targeted (but be mindful of his waves).

If that doesn't work, you should keep an eye on the death hits you get and once it starts hitting over 300, you may want to put an Energy Ring again until the curse is gone. Keep Terofar on diagonal all the time, so you can avoid his waves, keep summoning Fire Devils in case they die, and just shoot it down with your Wand of Defiance/Glacial Rod and Sudden Death Runes. It will take around 10 minutes before it dies even if you are a high level.\nIt's also wise to carry few Mastermind Potions along and drink one of them each time you failed to react fast enough and got yourself hitted with Skill lowering wave.\nPaladins: You can start killing it pretty smooth around 400 level. Just stay on diagonal, keep on using Sharpshooter along with Great Spirit Potions and shoot it down with Infernal Bolts, Sudden Death Runes and occasional Strong Ethereal Spear. Remember to heal yourself to full before casting each Sharpshooter. It's also wise to carry Energy Ring and Pot of Blackjack/Rotworm Stew in case things go south and you can't overheal the damage you get.\nKnights: It's totally or at least nearly impossible to kill it as a Knight.

The cultists must be kept away or else Abomination will devour them and refill his health. This way, shooters and healers will stay closer to the center of the room. It's advised to stand in diagonal of it in order to avoid its plus-shaped attack that goes along the entire room (if you are further from the Abomination, even outside of its vision, but still standing directly in front of it vertically or horizontally, you'll get hit). When The Abomination says a vocation's name, every character from that vocation should retreat for a few seconds (6-8?) until it casts an area spell that affects character from the said vocation. When it mentions the knight vocation, the main blocker is advised to retreat to the north, not luring it into the shooters and healers. When it says \"YOU ALL .. WILL .... DIE!!!\", a 10-second timer will be visible under its name and everyone should pay attention to it and retreat before the timer ends in order to avoid its special \"doom\" spell. This \"doom\" is UE-shaped and includes another plus-shape attack which will reach across the whole room, so once again do not stand directly in front of the boss, even if it is outside of your screen. It should be easier to avoid this AOE by running diagonally to the boss, since it also becomes very slow during this period.

You have 10 seconds to kill the Organic Matter or the boss will eat it and recover half of its maximum HP. After the Organic Matter is killed, 4 Aggressive Matters will spawn. Kill them quickly as well because they deal considerable damage. Repeat this process until you finally kill boss. Due to the lava geysers (explode dealing 1500 Fire Damage) and Aggressive Lava around the room, it's recommended for all players to use equipment that provide fire protection. Blockers should use Life Drain Protection, they will receive more this type of damage than any other type.",

It is not a very good idea to try to outrun it, as its heavy paralysis and ability to haste make this very difficult. If you are lucky enough, a Giant Spider will stand in front of you, not The Old Widow, and then you will have an easy time killing it (for mages and paladins). Knights just kill the Giant Spider and then The Old Widow.If your level is below 90, it's wise to use Stone Skin Amulets (2-4 may be enough) and Might Rings to increase you chances. \nMages: This is a hard monster to solo as a mage, try not to face it below level 80 as 2,000+ mana and the use of Great Mana Potions are recommended. Since it is a very fast creature, Wild Growth/Magic Walls will come in handy. Use Magic Shield because it can hit 600 easily. Unlike Giant Spiders, The Old Widow is strong to Fire Damage so Hell's Core will hit less. Take a Wand of Voodoo or Underworld Rod and attack it with Sudden Death runes while drinking plenty of Great Mana Potions. Terra Set is also recommended, although you might want to wear a Protection Amulet or Stone Skin Amulet rather than a Terra Amulet. If your level is below 60 then you will most likely die even with Magic Shield, however, it is possible for a level 60 mage to solo The Old Widow using Energy Walls and Sudden Death runes.\nPaladins: Level 80+ can kill it by using Assassin Stars and Energy Ring. Before you pass into the teleport, make sure you use Haste or Strong Haste to avoid being trapped and once you get inside the boss room, keep using Strong Mana Potions or Great Spirit Potions when your mana falls low.\nKnights: Level 90+ can kill it by using Defensive Fighting, Great Health Potions and Fierce Berserk. Always drink Mana Potions and use Fierce Berserk with full hp. If your level is below 80 you will have high chances to die, because The Old Widow will deal you more damage than you can recover from. It is highly recommended to cast Blood Rage, then combine with Berserk, Fierce Berserk, Brutal Strike and Front Sweep.",

The fight is very easy and there is pretty much no danger of dying, a team of players around level 50 should be enough to do it. In order to defeat the Percht Queen, you must first unfreeze it. To do so, you'll have to do the following steps: 1. As soon as you pull the lever, you'll be in a small room with a Warm Bonfire  and Vortex of Nature , here. Use the bonfire and a Percht Warding Torch  will appear in front of it, pick it up. 2. Step on the Vortex and your appearance will change to a Leaf Golem. 3. Go down, and then quickly go all the way to the other side of the dungeon, here. Do not go north. When you step near the wall, a Rush Wood (Quest)  (tree) will appear. Use it 5 times, each time a Branch  will appear in front of the tree, pick them all up. 4. Go to the south where there will be a Burn Out Bonfire , here. If it's not lit, use your torch on it and light it up, so it changes into a Smoldering Bonfire . Start using the wood on the bonfire. 5. After using all the wood, go back to the west side, transform yourself into the Leaf Golem and repeat this process until the bonfire is so big that it's a Blazing Bonfire  and a Warm Fire  appears (20 Branches are necessary). 6. When the Warm Fire appears, the bonfire will stop burning, use a torch on it again (the torch only lasts for 40 seconds, so you'll also need to constantly pick up a new one). Then, use the bonfire and you'll start burning yourself . 7. Lure the Warm Fire to the north, but be careful because the Percht Minions will try to kill it. Also avoid the Ice beams that come from the north of the room. The Warm Fire will explode and deal damage to The Percht Queen. Repeat the process above until The Percht Queen is not frozen anymore (required 4 Warm Fires) and can be killed by the players. Important notes:",

During the fight without Primal Pack Beasts a Knight should keep the boss at the middle of the room and shooters stay around the room to observe the environment for spawning Primal Pods and Primal Pack Beasts - besides shooters should simply strike the boss with Sudden Death Runes. It is advised for Paladins to use bow with Diamond Arrow to avoid changing the bow and crossbow during the fight to minimize the risk of losing attack turns. Mages should preserve their Hell's Core and Eternal Winter spells for the summons. Any time a Primal Pod spawns, anybody nearby (including the Knight) should run and step on it immediately - otherwise a Fungosaurus will spawn,  which will decrease your chances of completing the boss significantly. At some point the boss will start to summon Primal Pack Beasts. Shooters have to be careful and attempt to run to the opposite side of the room from the spawning summon (to not get the agro at all) while the Knight should go closer to the spawning Primal Pack Beast and challenge it as soon as possible. Once done the Knight should attempt to return to the middle of the room. Moments with Primal Pack Beast summons When this happens, the shooters should focus on AoE damage. The rune used should be Great Fireball Runes. Sorcerers should wave the box with his fire and energy waves while Druids should use their Terra Wave as frequently as possible as you have approximately 10 turns to kill the Primal Pack Beast - otherwise it will transform into Fungosaurus. The terra wave of Druid is not effective to The Primal Menace, nevertheless it works fine against Primal Pack Beasts and Fungosauruses and it should be your priority to kill it as fast as possible. It is advised that one of the team members pay special attention to the time of killing the summons - and if there are chances that one of these will transform into a Fungosaurus the mages should cast their Hell's Core and/or Eternal Winter spells immediately. It may also happen that you won't be able to kill the summons on time and a Fungosaurus will spawn in place of not killed Primal Pack Beast. It is a quite critical situation for the team - the Knight loses his mobility as the Fungosaurus causes Feared status, so that Knight has to use Fire Bomb Rune to avoid randomly running. Summons will keep spawning so it's fully on shooters now to lure the Primal Pack Beasts to the blocker. Note: The Knight has also to pay extra attention as Primal Pods that appear near him will clear any field from bombs, so they might need to be renewed to avoid random running due to the Feared status.

To have any chance of defeating The Ravager, your shooters must defeat all the Greater Canopic Jars while the knight forces The Ravager to bring all the Canopic Jars closer to him. When all the Canopic Jars are bunched together, the knight should move so that The Ravager is out of the healing range of the Canopic Jars but is still in the range so that the jars will not despawn. When the positioning has been set up the team should focus on trapping and killing The Ravager. Do not allow him to move when set up. Preferably, the knight will be diagonal to The Ravager, and will have the boss trapped with Wild Growth Runes or Magic Wall Runes. The shooters should position themselves behind the knight when it is trapped, so that it will not escape the trap to attack another party member.",

Make sure all spawns are lured away from the boss and that they will not roam around. If a spawn roams and finds you killing the boss, they will heal it back to full health very quickly. Once the spawns are away from the boss, focus all your firepower on it. It is soloable by luring the spawns away from the boss. However, due to the difficulty of that and the chance of spawns roaming to you, it is strongly recommend you bring a group.\nwill heal itself once on red hp and a message will appear,while a Spawn of the Welter will disappear :<the welter devours his spawn and heals himself>",

His executions are lengthy procedures as he enjoys the fear and death struggle of his victims. As he is mostly confronted with helpless victims, it might confuse him if an opponent is actually fighting back. Still, it is very unlikely that someone will face the chief executioner of the Ruthless Seven and lives to tell the tale.

When under maximum stacks, characters will take 15% maximum health Agony Damage per second. Each time a player moves, they \"drop\" these charges on the ground, leaving  Darklight Spark as tracks and reducing the counter by one. Stepping or staying over the Darklight Sparks causes 3% maximum health per second as Agony Damage. After three seconds, the Darklight Sparks turn into their second stage,  Darklight Fields, which last for two seconds but also cause 3% maximum health agony damage immediately upon being stepped on. Therefore, players can take take up to 18% maximum health per second if not handling these carefully. The boss can summon multiple  Pillars of Dark Energy. These can chain players for Energy Damage. When taking damage from this chain spell, a different counter is applied to the characters hit by it. This counter is reduced at a rate of one per second and deals 1,200~ Energy Damage with every tick. The maximum counter value is 10. Players should be extra careful when having these because getting hit by Vemiath's beam spell will trigger all charges at once, dealing a high Energy Damage outburst. Every 90 seconds, a  Rotten Charge will appear at the center of the room, lasting for 15 seconds. Players must lure an Elder Bloodjaw into it.

The shooters should be spread out through the room, and should use SD runes on Yakchal. Be careful when waking her, because you will also wake up a huge number of Ice Witches, Ice Golems, Crystal Spiders and Frost Dragons. (In four 'waves', approximately 6-8 Frost Dragons, 10~ Crystal Spiders, 15~ Ice Witches, 20-30 Ice Golems and the Yakchal will spawn in only the south of the room! More monsters, mainly Ice Golems and Crystal Spiders, will spawn in the west, north and east in the room.) Those creatures will not all come at the same time. One strategy is to use the south-east corner of the room as a retreat-point when a lot of monsters are summoned. First make sure to kill all the summons, then trap Yakchal with an Energy Bomb Rune, so she won't move. Then finish her off with SD:s. Another strategy is having 1 person awaken her, and then rush to the south doors. Use a Frozen Starlight on the sarcophagus to awaken her (The Frozen Starlight can break when it's used on the sarcophagus to awake the Yakchal, but usually it won't. You can awaken Yakchal many times, but the delay between awakenings is random.  To be compared with:  Make sure somebody blocks respawn on the other side, otherwise there could be a Demon, Plaguesmiths and Nightmares. If you're fast enough, you won't have to go to the other side of the door to be safe from the most of the creatures that will spawn with the awakening.\nFrom those doors, you can then slowly lure all creatures one by one, and sooner or later Yakchal will come too. Unless your team has a lot of firepower, try to trap her in a corner somewhere, she will run away in very low health.\nShoot at her with Sudden Death runes and/or Assassin Stars.",

        "notes": "He is a Ruthless Seven Servant, and you must defeat him in order to proceed through The Inquisition Quest. Despite his might, the demon known as Zugurosh is a coward, and he would be the first to admit that - if he were threatened enough. Zugurosh spent a good part of his past hiding from real and assumed enemies. Seeking for protection, he joined the ranks of The Ruthless Seven soon after they had established themselves as the mightiest of all surviving cabals. Though he is quick on the uptake, his cowardice prevented him from gaining any significant power until his paranoia helped him to discover a treachery in the ranks of The Ruthless Seven Minions. This granted him the attention of his dark masters and a rather high position in their ranks that only resulted in intensifying his fears. Zugurosh prefers to be a living coward than a dead hero. Ironically his cowardice and paranoia made him a valuable tool for The Ruthless Seven who entrusted him with several safety measures for their numerous operations. Assuming enemies and betrayal everywhere, Zugurosh is responsible for some of the most important and essential safety measures of The Ruthless Seven. He has a rather unique network of bribed and threatened informants. Though treachery and backstabbing is quite common among demons, this kind of controlled betrayal on a grand scale is a rather unusual concept for their race, and so far it works quite well. Zugurosh hates every fair fight, and he ensures that things are in his favour before he makes his move. He enjoys to prey upon helpless victims and loves nothing more than cheap victories using deceit, traps and ambushes. Since demons do not mind much about such tactics, Zugurosh is quite respected by his kind. It's one of the bosses of The Inquisition Quest.",

This can be done by putting shooters or Summoned Creatures close to the pillars since they target the nearest player.

Throughout the entire battle, Frost Spiders will spawn along the horizontal line in the center of the temple and up to 4? Frost Servants will spawn by the altar. These will stop spawning when Zushuka is dead, but the spawned monsters will not disappear when Zushuka is killed. In the first stage, Zushuka is invincible and her clothing is of a lighter color. To progress to stage 2, the glowing ice cubes on the west and east side of the heart of the temple must be destroyed. To destroy the cubes, take a Thawing Ice Pick from the altar (center) and quickly run to the west or east side to use the pickaxe on the cubes. You must do this on 3 cubes on each side. Note that the thawing ice picks will vanish (and respawn) after 5 seconds, and the decaying starts immediately when it spawns. It is recommended to first move a thawing ice pick, wait for it to disappear and pick up the new one from the same spot on the altar, thus giving you maximum time to use it. You may also add it to a hotkey or action button. Keep in mind that while you run from the altar to the glowing ice cubes, there will be a massive amount of Frost Spiders which aim to slow you down and block your path. If you cannot manage, you can use Energy Bomb Runes or Energy Walls to create a clear path from the altar to the cubes. Alternatively, a knight can block the majority of the spiders while another player runs the thawing ice picks. Also keep in mind that Zushuka can deal a massive amount of damage herself. Since you can't do anything with her right now, it is recommended to lure her away from the center while you progress. In the second stage, the invincible Zushuka will disappear and a new one, in a darker blue outfit, will spawn by the altar. Zushuka can now be killed. Hold off the minions and kill the boss. When Zushuka reaches low health, she will recover about half its health points (~7500 hp), but only once. This may be a long battle so it is recommended to bring plenty of supplies.",
