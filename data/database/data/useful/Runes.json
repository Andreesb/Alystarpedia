For instance, a Dead Snake weights 12 oz and is usable for 11 minutes.\nThere are certain rules governing when the rune may be used:\n\nYou must stand next to a corpse (it cannot be in your backpack) and the tile (or an adjacent one) must be free for the summon to spawn. It's possible to summon a skeleton while the character and the corpse are both inside a Protection Zone.\nYou cannot use the rune on non-decaying corpses or special corpse-alike objects like the Dead Frog (Item) dropped by Dark Apprentices. However, at the time of writing, Lizard Snakecharmers still drop a regular snake corpse.\nIt cannot be used on a first stage of corpse decay of certain creatures: humans, but they decay quickly.\nYou cannot use it during the first 10 seconds after killing a monster, as the rune will destroy a corpse like a Disintegrate Rune.\nFor the spell, see Animate Dead.",

For a total of 90 health lost in 1 minute.\nThis field spell is useful as a secondary attack rune that helps speed up killing players and monsters. This fire field also provides more light if compared to the other field spells. Quite useful as this field rune provides the most damage for a single hit but it takes long for all the damage to kick in, if you want fast damage use Energy Field.\nThe first stage of the fire field lasts 3:20; the second stage lasts for 2:28; the last stage (that does not block a monster) lasts 1:38.  Total time that a fire field will block a monster is 5:48.\nFor the spell, see Fire Field.",

The amount changes with the magic level and level of the user.\nMost frequently, players use this rune on themselves, but it can also be used to rescue a fellow player or a summoned creature from dying.Druids or Sorcerers using this rune on themselves are guaranteed to heal completely because their magic power is a lot higher and their maximum hit points are much lower than knights or paladins of equal level.\nPrior to the Christmas Update of 2007, this rune was widely used by knights, however, after the update they are not longer useful for knights or paladins.\nThis rune can be used by mages to heal themselves or their blocker. Ultimate Healing Rune (Item) is by average around 5% weaker than Heal Friend (at higher levels difference is near 4%). The biggest advantage of this rune is that it has the highest minimal healing, making it the safest healing in critical fights. For example, if you heal your blocker with two very weak heal friend spells in a row which may not be enough to keep blocker alive, this rune have higher minimal healing which may be safer and less luck-based healing. Keep in mind, using this rune shares cooldown with other runes and potions.\nFor the spell, see Ultimate Healing Rune.",

The main difference is that ammunition, spells and runes may also be shot through Wild Growth. \nOn Open PvP, Retro Open PvP, Hardcore PvP and Retro Hardcore PvP words, they can be destroyed using a Heavy Machete or Machete. On Optional PvP worlds they can be destroyed by walking over them. \nThe cost to make one of these runes with regular mana potions and selling the vials is around 135 gps, so having the soul points and the time, it is better to make them with mana potions than buy them on NPC. \nFor the spell, see Wild Growth.",
